The world’s largest nuclear fusion project began its five-year assembly phase on Tuesday in southern France, with the first ultra-hot plasma expected to be generated in late 2025.
The €20bn (£18.2bn) Iter project will replicate the reactions that power the sun and is intended to demonstrate fusion power can be generated on a commercial scale. Nuclear fusion promises clean, unlimited power but, despite 60 years of research, it has yet to overcome the technical challenges of harnessing such extreme amounts of energy.
Millions of components will be used to assemble the giant reactor, which will weigh 23,000 tonnes and the project is the most complex engineering endeavour in history. Almost 3,000 tonnes of superconducting magnets, some heavier than a jumbo jet, will be connected by 200km of superconducting cables, all kept at -269C by the world’s largest cryogenic plant.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, launched the assembly phase, alongside senior figures from Iter members, the EU, UK, China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the US. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said: “I believe disruptive innovation will play a key role in addressing global issues including climate change and realising a sustainable carbon-free society.”
“Enabling the exclusive use of clean energy will be a miracle for our planet,” said Bernard Bigot, Iter director-general. He said fusion, alongside renewable energy, would allow transport, buildings and industry to run on electricity.
But Bigot said: “Constructing the machine piece-by-piece will be like assembling a three-dimensional puzzle on an intricate timeline [and] with the precision of a Swiss watch.” The Iter project was conceived in 1985 but has suffered delays.
Nuclear fusion releases vast amounts of energy when heavy hydrogen atoms fuse together, but this requires a temperature of 150m C, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The hydrogen fuel is obtained from seawater and just a few grammes is needed but huge magnets are needed to contain the plasma in doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber known as a tokamak.

Nuclear fusion in the Iter reactor

Like conventional nuclear fission reactors, the process itself does not produce climate-warming carbon dioxide but fusion reactors cannot meltdown and produce much less radioactive waste.
The Iter project will be the first to achieve a “burning” or self-heating plasma and is expected to generate 10 times more heat than is put in, far more than any previous attempt. It will also use a significant amount of electrical energy when it is running, to power the magnets and scientific instruments, But it is intended to be a proof-of-concept of large-scale fusion, not a design for a future commercial reactor.
Among the components being assembled is the 30-metre-diameter cryostat, manufactured by India, which surrounds the reactor and keeps it at the extremely low temperature required. One of the electromagnets, called the central solenoid and built by the US, will have the magnetic power to lift an aircraft carrier.




After 60 years, is nuclear fusion finally poised to deliver?

There are numerous private-sector companies pursuing nuclear fusion via much smaller devices, including Tokamak Energy, based in the UK and which has raised £117m in investment. Its executive vice-chairman, David Kingham, said: “We welcome the progress at Iter which we see as a great scientific project and a major endorsement of tokamak devices.”
“But we are convinced that faster progress is possible, driven by the need for more carbon-free energy and enabled by private investment, modular designs, new materials and advanced technologies,” he said. Iter engineers said their giant project is the size that proven technologies can deliver.
Other nuclear fusion companies include Tri Alpha Energy, which harnesses particle accelerator technology and is working with Google, General Fusion, which uses a vortex of molten lead and lithium to contain the plasma and is backed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and First Light Fusion.

World’s largest nuclear fusion project begins assembly in France

In the end the West Indies, a noble team that has helped to rescue what might have been an utterly barren summer, ran out of steam. They were bowled out for 129 as briskly as the chill wind sweeping across the ground, occasionally bringing scudding showers. So England won the match by 269 runs and the series 2-1 to retain the Wisden Trophy forever.
Here the weather was England’s most troublesome opponent but for two Tests Jason Holder’s side has battled resolutely. Ultimately the shortcomings of batsmen in English conditions were exposed and their bowlers, a valiant quartet, were creaking after three Tests in swift succession. By contrast England’s bowlers, fresh and eager throughout, became ever more dominant. The strategy of rotating the bowlers has worked extremely well. None of them have bowled in more than two matches – not even Ben Stokes and Dom Bess, who played every game but were not required to bowl here.




England beat West Indies by 269 runs to win third Test and series – live!

In the process Stuart Broad with the minimum of fuss notched his 500th Test wicket to cap an irresistible performance. Inevitably he was the man of the match; his reaction to being omitted from the first Test has been staggering though it is doubtful that he will agree that being dropped – remember that England were aiming for their best side in that game at the Ageas Bowl – was a jolly good idea.
Broad did not keep us waiting long for the landmark. Kraigg Brathwaite, who was Jimmy Anderson’s 500th Test wicket, was the recipient of a nasty delivery. It scuttled through below knee height and this combined with Brathwaite’s habit of staying on the crease made the lbw decision straightforward for the umpire Michael Gough. There was no point in a West Indian review.
Broad may have dreamt of reaching 500 in front of a packed, sun-baked stadium. Here he briefly held up the ball to the empty stands and to the photographers scattered around the ground. The England players formed a semi-circle and applauded. Maybe there will be a proper audience when he gets 600.
Shai Hope, who has endured a wretched series without really looking out of form or out of his depth, looked as if he had decided to play with more freedom. Two sumptuous boundaries came from a Jofra Archer over and he had surpassed his highest score of the series (25) but on 31 he opted for a pull shot, which did not work well.

From the bottom of the bat the ball went skywards towards mid-on. It was swirling in the strong breeze and somebody needed to take responsibility. Who better than Broad to step up? The catch looked simpler than it was but he duly held it. Soon after Shamarh Brooks was caught behind off the inside edge for the second time in the match, on this occasion off Chris Woakes. Brooks has flickered engagingly in this series without producing the major innings. Hopefully he can flourish late in his career; he is always easy on the eye.
Another shower necessitated an early lunch. A blustery wind blowing from leg to off is not ideal for bowlers of any type but they stuck to their task, while the batsmen were inclined to play their shots even though the draw was their highest ambition. Even so the next dismissal was profligate whatever the situation. There was hesitation among the batsmen after Jermaine Blackwood had punched the ball square of the wicket. Dom Bess gathered the ball and his throw hit the stumps with Roston Chase a long way from home.
Bess, as Somerset followers have discovered, hits the stumps far more often than most. This was his solitary contribution in the field in this match. There is only one other occasion in the last 15 years that an England spinner has not bowled a ball in a Test match – when Adil Rashid was idle in the Lord’s Test of 2018 against India.
Now Woakes, a perpetual unsung hero in this series, took charge from the Jimmy Anderson End with a trio of lbws. Jason Holder, Shane Dowrich and Rahkeem Cornwall were all struck in front of the stumps and only Holder decided to review – to no avail. This has been an unusually common mode of dismissal for the tourists; there have been 19 lbws, a reflection of their techniques and the low-bouncing nature of the surfaces.

Woakes finished with five for 50; he had bowled England to a famous victory, not because of the tautness of the finish though the rain returned with a vengeance soon after the end of the game. This was memorable because we have never had a behind closed doors series before – and hopefully, after the Pakistan series, we never will again. But in typical fashion the self-effacing Woakes was always unlikely to dominate the headlines.
This was Broad’s day yet again; he joined the super-elite when reaching 500 and of course he returned to take the last wicket of the series from the first ball of a new spell. It was a rusty loosener that went down the leg-side; Blackwood had a swing and edged it. For Broad bowling has never been a simpler process. He finished the match with 10 for 67, 62 runs and 501 Test wickets. He was the man of the match and whatever the rotation plans it is now unthinkable that Broad and Woakes (let’s not forget him) will be left out of the team when Test cricket resumes here against Pakistan in a week’s time.

Broad reaches 500 as England demolish West Indies and regain Wisden Trophy

"
The abrupt closure of the Spain-UK air bridge came from nowhere for thousands of British tourists and an industry trying to get back on its feet.
Whitehall sources insist the swift and blanket nature of the decision – to advise against non-essential travel to Spain and impose quarantine measures on travellers arriving from the country - came because government scientists had been concerned by the coronavirus infection figures from Spain.




UK coronavirus live: Boris Johnson says 'signs of second wave of pandemic' in parts of Europe

Yet it was also down to lessons learned the hard way about slow v speedy decision-making over the course of the pandemic – the decision-making was as much about politics and messaging as hard data.
Advisers studying the figures at the end of last week say they were deeply concerned about the rate of the rise in Spain, and the potential for thousands of cases to be imported by tourists. Though low in number, the coronavirus cases detected in holidaymakers returning from Spain are believed to be the first from a country which had been previously deemed to be safe to visit.
During a meeting before the quarantine’s reimposition, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, made clear his strength of feeling about the level of risk from returning tourists.
Ministers wanted to act fast and make the advice clear rather than risk another major fallout by delaying a week – or even 24 hours – when it had the potential to cause an exponential increase in cases imported to the UK.
They did not want to be dogged by further accusations of tardy decision-making on lockdown measures; at one point the government was accused of doubling the Covid-19 death toll by delaying lockdown by one week.
“There was a genuine risk of the country seeing significant new infections from abroad,” one source said of the Spain quarantine decision. “If we had waited a week … people want to see quick and decisive action.”
The initial mismatch in Foreign Office advice – with non-essential travel to the Spanish islands still permissible – gave false hope to the travel industry that ministers might see fit to change the quarantine advice and allow visitors to go to favourite holiday destinations such as Mallorca, Ibiza, Tenerife or Lanzarote, where the small-business minister Paul Scully was holidaying when he was caught out by the quarantine imposition.
That was never on the cards, government sources insist, despite fierce lobbying by the travel industry and the Spanish government. Instead the advice was hardened overnight on Monday to advise against all non-essential travel to the islands as well as mainland Spain.
Again, the decision was based on risk – but also on needing a clear communications strategy. 
There was another challenge to navigate – the holiday plans of two key ministers, Michael Gove and Grant Shapps. Shapps, the transport secretary, departed for his family holiday in Spain knowing the advice could change at any moment but unwilling to appear as if he was acting on inside information by cancelling his trip.
Gove had booked a holiday to Ibiza and also knew the risks of appearing to be prioritising his own holiday plans by excluding the Spanish islands from the quarantine restrictions.
Shapps will fly back to start his quarantine from Wednesday – and to continue discussions about how the “blunt instrument” of a 14-day quarantine could be refined, whether through airport or home testing, regional quarantines or shorter isolation periods, which are all still believed to be in the early stages of exploration.

End of UK-Spain air bridge as much about politics as hard data

"
In the winter of 1959, after leading the Montgomery bus boycott that arose from the arrest of Rosa Parks and before the trials and triumphs to come, Martin Luther King Jr and his wife, Coretta, landed in India, in the city then known as Bombay, to visit the land of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of nonviolent protest. They were covered in garlands upon arrival, and King told reporters: “To other countries, I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim.”
He had long dreamed of going to India, and they stayed an entire month. King wanted to see for himself the place whose fight for freedom from British rule had inspired his fight for justice in America. He wanted to see the so-called “untouchables”, the lowest caste in the ancient Indian caste system, whom he had read about and had sympathy for, but who had still been left behind after India gained its independence the decade before.
He discovered that people in India had been following the trials of his own oppressed people in the US, and knew of the bus boycott he had led. Wherever he went, the people on the streets of Bombay and Delhi crowded around him for an autograph. At one point in their trip, King and his wife journeyed to the southern tip of the country, to the city of Trivandrum in the state of Kerala, and visited with high-school students whose families had been untouchables. The principal made the introduction.
“Young people,” he said, “I would like to present to you a fellow untouchable from the United States of America.”
King was floored. He had not expected that term to be applied to him. He was, in fact, put off by it at first. He had flown in from another continent, and had dined with the prime minister. He did not see the connection, did not see what the Indian caste system had to do directly with him, did not immediately see why the lowest-caste people in India would view him, an American Negro and a distinguished visitor, as low-caste like themselves, see him as one of them. “For a moment,” he wrote, “I was a bit shocked and peeved that I would be referred to as an untouchable.”
Then he began to think about the reality of the lives of the people he was fighting for – 20 million people, consigned to the lowest rank in the US for centuries, “still smothering in an airtight cage of poverty,” quarantined in isolated ghettoes, exiled in their own country.
And he said to himself: “Yes, I am an untouchable, and every negro in the United States of America is an untouchable.” In that moment, he realised that the land of the free had imposed a caste system not unlike the caste system of India, and that he had lived under that system all of his life. It was what lay beneath the forces he was fighting in the US.

What Martin Luther King Jr, recognised about his country that day had begun long before the ancestors of our ancestors had taken their first breaths. More than a century and a half before the American Revolution, a human hierarchy had evolved on the contested soil of what would become the United States – a concept of birthright, the temptation of entitled expansion that would set in motion what has been called the world’s oldest democracy and, with it, a ranking of human value and usage.
It would twist the minds of men, as greed and self-reverence eclipsed human conscience and allowed the conquering men to take land and human bodies that they convinced themselves they had a right to. If they were to convert this wilderness and civilise it to their liking, they decided, they would need to conquer, enslave or remove the people already on it, and transport those they deemed lesser beings in order to tame and work the land to extract the wealth that lay in the rich soil and shorelines.
To justify their plans, they took pre-existing notions of their own centrality, reinforced by their self-interested interpretation of the Bible, and created a hierarchy of who could do what, who could own what, who was on top and who was on the bottom and who was in between. There emerged a ladder of humanity, global in nature, as the upper-rung people would descend from Europe, with rungs inside that designation – the English Protestants at the very top, as their guns and resources would ultimately prevail in the bloody fight for North America. Everyone else would rank in descending order, on the basis of their proximity to those deemed most superior. The ranking would continue downward until one arrived at the very bottom: African captives transported in order to build the New World and to serve the victors for all their days, one generation after the next, for 12 generations.
There developed a caste system, based upon what people looked like – an internalised ranking, unspoken, unnamed and unacknowledged by everyday citizens even as they go about their lives adhering to it and acting upon it subconsciously, to this day. Just as the studs and joists and beams that form the infrastructure of a building are not visible to those who live in it, so it is with caste. Its very invisibility is what gives it power and longevity. And though it may move in and out of consciousness, though it may flare and reassert itself in times of upheaval and recede in times of relative calm, it is an ever-present through-line in the country’s operation.

A caste system is an artificial construction, a fixed and embedded ranking of human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of others, on the basis of ancestry and often of immutable traits – traits that would be neutral in the abstract, but are ascribed life-and-death meaning in a hierarchy favouring the dominant caste whose forebears designed it. A caste system uses rigid, often arbitrary boundaries to keep the ranked groupings apart, distinct from one another and in their assigned places.
Throughout human history, three caste systems have stood out. The tragically accelerated, chilling and officially vanquished caste system of Nazi Germany. The lingering, millennia-long caste system of India. And the shape-shifting, unspoken, race-based caste pyramid in the US. Each version relied on stigmatising those deemed inferior in order to justify the dehumanisation necessary to keep the lowest-ranked people at the bottom, and to rationalise the protocols of enforcement. A caste system endures because it is often justified as divine will, originating from a sacred text or the presumed laws of nature, reinforced throughout the culture and passed down through the generations.
As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theatre, the flashlight cast down the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power: which groups have it and which do not. It is about resources: which caste is seen as worthy of them, and which are not; who gets to acquire and control them, and who does not. It is about respect, authority and assumptions of competence: who is accorded these, and who is not.
As a means of assigning value to entire swaths of humankind, caste guides each of us, often beyond the reaches of our awareness. It embeds into our bones an unconscious ranking of human characteristics, and sets forth the rules, expectations and stereotypes that have been used to justify brutalities against entire groups within our species. In the American caste system, the signal of rank is what we call race, the division of humans on the basis of their appearance. In the US, race is the primary tool and the visible decoy – the frontman – for caste.

Race does the heavy lifting for a caste system that demands a means of human division. If we have been trained to see humans in the language of race, then caste is the underlying grammar that we encode as children, as when learning our mother tongue. Caste, like grammar, becomes an invisible guide not only to how we speak, but to how we process information – the autonomic calculations that figure into a sentence without our having to think about it. Many of us have never taken a class in grammar, yet we know in our bones that a transitive verb takes an object, that a subject needs a predicate, and we know without thinking the difference between third-person singular and third-person plural. We might mention “race”, referring to people as black or white or Latino or Asian or indigenous, when what lies beneath each label is centuries of history, and the assigning of assumptions and values to physical features in a structure of human hierarchy.
What people look like – or rather, the race they have been assigned, or are perceived to belong to – is the visible cue to their caste. It is the historic flashcard to the public, showing how people are to be treated, where they are expected to live, what kinds of positions they are expected to hold, whether they belong in this section of town or that seat in a boardroom, whether they should be expected to speak with authority on this or that subject, whether they will be administered pain relief in a hospital, whether their neighbourhood is likely to adjoin a toxic waste site or to have contaminated water flowing from their taps, whether they are more or less likely to survive childbirth in the most advanced nation in the world, whether they may be shot by authorities with impunity.
Caste and race are neither synonymous nor mutually exclusive. They can and do coexist in the same culture, and serve to reinforce each other. Caste is the bones, race the skin. Race is what we can see, the physical traits that have been given arbitrary meaning and become shorthand for who a person is. Caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place.
Caste is fixed and rigid. Race is fluid and superficial, subject to periodic redefinition to meet the needs of the dominant caste in what is now the US. While the requirements to qualify as white have changed over the centuries, the fact of a dominant caste has remained constant from its inception – whoever fit the definition of white, at whatever point in history, was granted the legal rights and privileges of the dominant caste. Perhaps more critically and tragically, at the other end of the ladder, the subordinated caste, too, has been fixed from the beginning as the psychological floor beneath which all other castes cannot fall.

Caste is not a term often applied to the US. It is considered the language of India or feudal Europe. But some anthropologists and scholars of race in the US have made use of the term for decades. Before the modern era, one of the earliest Americans to take up the idea of caste was the antebellum abolitionist and US senator Charles Sumner, as he fought against segregation in the north. “The separation of children in the Public Schools of Boston, on account of color or race,” he wrote, “is in the nature of Caste, and on this account is a violation of Equality.” He quoted a fellow humanitarian: “Caste makes distinctions among creatures where God has made none.”
We cannot fully understand the current upheavals, or almost any turning point in American history, without accounting for the human pyramid that is encrypted into us all. The caste system, and the attempts to defend, uphold or abolish the hierarchy, underlay the American civil war and the civil rights movement a century later, and pervade the politics of the 21st-century US. Just as DNA is the code of instructions for cell development, caste has been the operating system for economic, political and social interaction in the US since the time of its gestation.
In 1944, the Swedish social economist Gunnar Myrdal and a team of the most talented researchers in the country produced a 2,800-page, two-volume work that is still considered perhaps the most comprehensive study of race in the US. It was titled An American Dilemma. Myrdal’s investigation into race led him to the realisation that the most accurate term to describe the workings of US society was not race, but caste – and that perhaps it was the only term that really addressed what seemed a stubbornly fixed ranking of human value.
The anthropologist Ashley Montagu was among the first to argue that race is a human invention – a social construct, not a biological one – and that in seeking to understand the divisions and disparities in the US, we have typically fallen into the quicksand and mythology of race. “When we speak of ‘the race problem in America’,” he wrote in 1942, “what we really mean is the caste system and the problems which that caste system creates in America.”
There was little confusion among some of the leading white supremacists of the previous century as to the connections between India’s caste system and that of the American south, where the purest legal caste system in the US existed. “A record of the desperate efforts of the conquering upper classes in India to preserve the purity of their blood persists to until this very day in their carefully regulated system of castes,” wrote Madison Grant, a popular eugenicist, in his 1916 bestseller, The Passing of the Great Race. “In our Southern States, Jim Crow cars and social discriminations have exactly the same purpose.”
In 1913, Bhimrao Ambedkar, a man born to the bottom of India’s caste system, born an untouchable in the central provinces, arrived in New York City from Bombay. He came to the US to study economics as a graduate student at Columbia, focused on the differences between race, caste and class. Living just blocks from Harlem, he would see first-hand the condition of his counterparts in the US. He completed his thesis just as the film The Birth of a Nation – the incendiary homage to the Confederate south – premiered in New York in 1915. He would study further in London and return to India to become the foremost leader of the untouchables, and a pre-eminent intellectual who would help draft a new Indian constitution. He would work to dispense with the demeaning term “untouchable”. He rejected the term Harijans, which had been applied to them by Gandhi, to their minds patronisingly. He renamed his people Dalits, meaning “broken people” – which, due to the caste system, they were.

It is hard to know what effect his exposure to the American social order had on him personally. But over the years, he paid close attention, as did many Dalits, to the subordinate caste in the US. Indians had long been aware of the plight of enslaved Africans, and of their descendants in the US. Back in the 1870s, after the end of slavery and during the brief window of black advancement known as Reconstruction, an Indian social reformer named Jyotirao Phule found inspiration in the US abolitionists. He expressed hope “that my countrymen may take their example as their guide”.
Many decades later, in the summer of 1946, acting on news that black Americans were petitioning the United Nations for protection as minorities, Ambedkar reached out to the best-known African American intellectual of the day, WEB Du Bois. He told Du Bois that he had been a “student of the Negro problem” from across the oceans, and recognised their common fates.
“There is so much similarity between the position of the Untouchables in India and of the position of the Negroes in America,” Ambedkar wrote to Du Bois, “that the study of the latter is not only natural but necessary.”
Du Bois wrote back to Ambedkar to say that he was, indeed, familiar with him, and that he had “every sympathy with the Untouchables of India”. It had been Du Bois who seemed to have spoken for the marginalised in both countries as he identified the doubleconsciousness of their existence. And it was Du Bois who, decades before, had invoked an Indian concept in channelling the “bitter cry” of his people in the US: “Why did God make me an outcast and a stranger in mine own house?”

I began investigating the American caste system after nearly two decades of examining the history of the Jim Crow south, the legal caste system that grew out of enslavement and lasted into the early 70s, within the lifespans of many present-day Americans. I discovered that I was not writing about geography and relocation, but about the American caste system – an artificial hierarchy in which most everything that you could and could not do was based upon what you looked like, and which manifested itself north and south. I had been writing about a stigmatised people – 6 million of them – who were seeking freedom from the caste system in the south, only to discover that the hierarchy followed them wherever they went, much in the way that the shadow of caste (as I would soon discover) follows Indians in their own global diaspora.
The American caste system began in the years after the arrival of the first Africans to the Colony of Virginia in the summer of 1619, as the colony sought to refine the distinctions of who could be enslaved for life and who could not. Over time, colonial laws granted English and Irish indentured servants greater privileges than the Africans who worked alongside them, and the Europeans were fused into a new identity – that of being categorised as white, the polar opposite of black. The historian Kenneth M Stampp called this assigning of race a “caste system, which divided those whose appearance enabled them to claim pure Caucasian ancestry from those whose appearance indicated that some or all of their forebears were Negroes”. Members of the Caucasian caste, as he called it, “believed in ‘white supremacy’, and maintained a high degree of caste solidarity to secure it”.
While I was in the midst of my research, word of my inquiries spread to some Indian scholars of caste based in the US. They invited me to speak at an inaugural conference on caste and race at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, the town where WEB Du Bois was born and where his papers are kept.
There, I told the audience that I had written a 600-page book about the Jim Crow era in the American south – the time of naked white supremacy – but that the word “racism” did not appear anywhere in the narrative. I told them that, after spending 15 years studying the topic and hearing the testimony of the survivors of the era, I had realised that the term was insufficient. “Caste” was the more accurate term, and I set out to them the reasons why. They were both stunned and heartened. The plates of Indian food kindly set before me at the reception thereafter sat cold due to the press of questions and the sharing that went on into the night.
At a closing ceremony, the hosts presented to me a bronze-coloured bust of the patron saint of the low-born of India, Bhimrao Ambedkar, the Dalit leader who had written to Du Bois all those decades before.
It felt like an initiation into a caste to which I had somehow always belonged. Over and over, they shared stories of what they had endured, and I responded in personal recognition, as if even to anticipate some particular turn or outcome. To their astonishment, I began to be able to tell who was high-born and who was low-born among the Indian people there, not from what they looked like, as one might in the US, but on the basis of the universal human response to hierarchy – in the case of an upper-caste person, an inescapable certitude in bearing, demeanour, behaviour and a visible expectation of centrality.
On the way home, I was snapped back into my own world when airport security flagged my suitcase for inspection. The TSA worker happened to be an African American who looked to be in his early 20s. He strapped on latex gloves to begin his work. He dug through my suitcase and excavated a small box, unwrapped the folds of paper and held in his palm the bust of Ambedkar that I had been given.
“This is what came up in the X-ray,” he said. It was heavy like a paperweight. He turned it upside down and inspected it from all sides, his gaze lingering at the bottom of it. He seemed concerned that something might be inside.

“I’ll have to swipe it,” he warned me. He came back after some time and declared it OK, and I could continue with it on my journey. He looked at the bespectacled face, with its receding hairline and steadfast expression, and seemed to wonder why I would be carrying what looked like a totem from another culture.
“So who is this?” he asked.
“Oh,” I said, “this is the Martin Luther King of India.”
“Pretty cool,” he said, satisfied now, and seeming a little proud.
He then wrapped Ambedkar back up as if he were King himself, and set him back gently into the suitcase.

The lawyers say attorneys for women who claim Maxwell recruited and abused them should be subject to the same secrecy rules as prosecutors and Maxwell’s defense lawyers.

The lawyers, though, said it was one topic that prosecutors and defense lawyers for the British woman could not agree on as they composed a proposed agreement to keep evidence secret prior to a trial scheduled in Manhattan federal court for July 2021.
Maxwell, 58, who has been incarcerated without bail since her arrest several weeks ago, has pleaded not guilty to charges that she recruited and aided the abuse of three girls by Epstein in the 1990s.
Epstein committed suicide in a Manhattan lockup last August as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges related to the abuse of women and girls in Manhattan and Florida in the early 2000s.
The proposed order, submitted to a judge Monday, would prevent prosecutors and Maxwell’s lawyers from releasing any information to the internet or elsewhere, including “nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals”.
The joint protective order is routine in sex abuse cases.
But the lawyers said in a letter to the judge that prosecutors have refused to agree that witnesses in the trial and their lawyers should be subject to the secrecy rules.
Maxwell’s lawyers cited current civil litigation between Maxwell and “many of the government’s potential witnesses”, saying numerous potential witnesses and their lawyers have already publicly commented about the case.
“There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery materials to support their civil cases and future public statements,” the lawyers wrote.
Prosecutors said they’ll respond Tuesday.

Ghislaine Maxwell: lawyers ask judge to stop accusers from posting evidence online

For all their promise of romance and adventure, Europe’s sleeper trains had appeared to have reached the end of the line.
Cripplingly expensive to run and forsaken by travellers for budget airlines, a decision by the German rail operator Deutsche Bahn to terminate the service connecting Paris to Berlin six years ago ushered in the closure of routes across the continent including almost all of France’s network.
But as Europe continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, there are tentative signs of a new dawn for the couchettes and twin bunks, as the concerns of both governments and travellers’ over the environmental impact of short-haul flights are being complemented by a desire to avoid airport departure lounges and security queues.
In the last few weeks there has been a flurry of announcements and inaugural journeys. Last Thursday the Swedish government said it would provide funds for two new routes to connect the cities of Stockholm and Malmö with Hamburg and Brussels.

Map of sleeper services

A few days earlier, France’s transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said an overnight service would be resurrected between Paris and Nice following Emmanuel Macron’s Bastille Day promise to redevelop night trains for the nation.
Leading the way has been the Austrian operator Österreichische Bundesbahnen (ÖBB), which had the foresight to buy 42 sleeper cars from Deutsche Bahn in 2016. It has resumed half of the night-time routes connecting Hamburg, Berlin, Munich and Düsseldorf to Austria, Switzerland and Italy.
Despite a recent rise in the number of coronavirus infections in Belgium, up 71% week-on-week, a Brussels-Vienna service, which opened in February offering one-way trips from as low as €29.90 (£27.25), will recommence in September.
Along with government action there is evidence of renewed enthusiasm among the paying public too, as people reflect more deeply on how they travel amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
A new summer night train linking five EU member states – the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia – had barely started setting off from Prague on 30 June when the level of demand from holidaymakers heading to the coast ensured it was upgraded to a daily service.
The Swedish rail company Snälltåget said in June it planned to quadruple the number of night trains on its Stockholm-Malmö-Copenhagen-Hamburg-Berlin route. A new Alpine-Sylt night express that began operating between Sylt in northern Germany and Salzburg in Austria was also due to run for only two months but will continue until November due to demand.

“What I am told by people using my site is two things in the same breath: they are fed up with the airport experience and they want to cut their carbon footprint,” said Mark Smith, who runs the award-winning Man in Seat 61 railway website offering information on pan-European services. “Certainly, in the short term, I am getting people commenting that they don’t want to fly [because of the pandemic]. I think climate change will be the bigger one in the long term because hopefully this pandemic will [be] over at some point.”
The recovery of the night train may not be all smooth running, however, as the economics of night services remain difficult.
A normal high-speed train can accommodate 70 people in a coach and take multiple journeys a day, offering a number of stops. A sleeper might hold 20 to 30 beds in a coach but the majority of its passengers will travel end-to-end. The rolling stock is used for just one journey over a 24-hour period. 
Train services have had to pay track access charges as they cross borders since 2000. New services run by private companies are often just for the summer months, while state operators are taking huge government handouts in order to re-establish their overnight routes.
As a result, some of the most romantic night train journeys that were still running when the pandemic struck may still be discontinued, including the Thello Paris-Venice night train service and the Trenhotel Lusitania, which runs between Lisbon and Madrid.

Karima Delli, a French MEP who chairs the European parliament’s transport committee, welcomed governments’ loosening of their purse strings. “Relaunching night trains is both a necessity and an ecological solution to the planet,” she said.
But Alexander Gomme, from the Back on Track Belgium campaign group, said there needed to be a wider rethink of the costs to allow private operators to thrive, raise standards and take advantage of the new mentality.
“‘More state’ is a possibility but another is that the European Union makes it easier and cheaper for operators to book track access,” he said. “Night trains do a lot of kilometres and access charges are counted in kilometres.”
Nick Brooks, the secretary general of the Alliance of Rail New Entrants, which represents independent providers, argued that governments should also prohibit airlines receiving state bailouts from operating any short-haul or late-night flights that could be done by train. “This pandemic must lead to a better appreciation for rail,” he said.

Ecuador has sounded the alarm after its navy discovered a huge fishing fleet of mostly Chinese-flagged vessels some 200 miles from the Galápagos Islands, the archipelago which inspired Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.
About 260 ships are currently in international waters just outside a 188-mile wide exclusive economic zone around the island, but their presence has already raised the prospect of serious damage to the delicate marine ecosystem, said a former environment minister, Yolanda Kakabadse.
“This fleet’s size and aggressiveness against marine species is a big threat to the balance of species in the Galápagos,” she told the Guardian.
Kakabadse and an ex-mayor of Quito, Roque Sevilla, were on Monday put in charge of designing a “protection strategy” for the islands, which lie 563 miles west of the South American mainland.

Chinese fishing vessels come every year to the seas around the Galápagos, which were declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1978, but this year’s fleet is one of the largest seen in recent years.
Sevilla said that diplomatic efforts would be made to request the withdrawal of the Chinese fishing fleet. “Unchecked Chinese fishing just on the edge of the protected zone is ruining Ecuador’s efforts to protect marine life in the Galápagos,” he said.
He added that the team would also seek to enforce international agreements that protect migratory species. The Galápagos marine reserve has one of the world’s greatest concentrations of shark species, including endangered whale and hammerhead varieties.
Kakabadse said efforts would also be made to extend the exclusive economic zone to a 350-mile circumference around the islands which would join up with the Ecuadorian mainland’s economic zone, closing off a corridor of international waters in between the two where the Chinese fleet is currently located.

Ecuador is also trying to establish a corridor of marine reserves between Pacific-facing neighbours Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia which would seal off important areas of marine diversity, Kakabadse said.
Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, described the archipelago as “one of the richest fishing areas and a seedbed of life for the entire planet”, in a message on Twitter over the weekend.
The Galápagos Islands are renowned for their unique plants and wildlife. Unesco describes the archipelago – visited by a quarter of a million tourists every year – as a “living museum and a showcase for evolution”.
The Ecuadorian navy has been monitoring the fishing fleet since it was spotted last week, according to the country’s defence minister, Oswaldo Jarrín. “We are on alert, [conducting] surveillance, patrolling to avoid an incident such as what happened in 2017,” he said.
The 2017 incident he referred to was the capture by the Ecuadorean navy within the Galápagos marine reserve of a Chinese vessel. The Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999, part of an even larger fleet than the current one, was found to be carrying 300 tonnes of marine wildlife, mostly sharks.
“We were appalled to discover that a massive Chinese industrial fishing fleet is currently off the Galápagos Islands,” said John Hourston, a spokesman for the Blue Planet Society, a NGO which campaigns against overfishing.

Alarm over discovery of hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels near Galápagos Islands

China has suspended Hong Kong’s extradition treaties with Canada, Australia, and the UK, in a tit-for-tat move after similar decisions by those countries over its controversial new security law.
On Tuesday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs said Hong Kong was suspending criminal assistance agreements, including extradition, accusing those countries of “politicising judicial cooperation”. Canada, Australia and the UK cancelled extradition agreements with the semi-autonomous territory after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law that critics fear will be used against government critics.
“China has decided to suspend extradition treaties between Hong Kong and Canada, Australia and UK, as well as criminal justice cooperation agreements,” said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a regular press briefing, accusing the countries of having used the national security law as “an excuse to unilaterally announce the suspension of extradition treaties” with Hong Kong.
“The wrong action of Canada, Australia and the UK in politicising judicial cooperation with Hong Kong has seriously hurt the basis of judicial cooperation,” he said.
A spokesman for the Hong Kong government echoed Beijing’s remarks, calling the measures “a gross interference in China’s internal affairs and a grave violation of international law and basic norms”.
Western nations have angered Beijing over their responses to the law imposed on Hong Kong, which they see as an erosion of the civil liberties and human rights the city has enjoyed since its handover from Britain in 1997.
The US has decided to rescind Hong Kong’s special trading privileges while Washington’s “Five Eyes” intelligence partners have suspended their extradition treaties with the city, with New Zealand on Tuesday joining Canada, Britain and Australia. The United States has signalled it is preparing to do the same.
On Tuesday, the European Union began limiting technology exports to Hong Kong that may be used for repression or suppression. The EU agreed on Friday to EU to sanctions, trade curbs and review of visa agreements with the territory as a response to the security law. The document went into effect on Tuesday.
China has defended the security law as crucial to restore order in Hong Kong following a wave of pro-democracy protests since last year.
Britain suspended its extradition treaty last week, following moves by Australia and Canada, saying the security law had “significantly changed key assumptions” including a provision to try certain cases in mainland China.
London and Canberra have also angered Beijing by offering pathways to citizenship or residency to Hong Kongers looking to leave because of the new law.
New Zealand’s updated travel advice said the security law had led to an increased risk of arrest for activities such as protests, with the possibility of being removed to mainland China to face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

Wang warned on Tuesday that China reserved the right to respond after New Zealand suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong.
“Any schemes to suppress China will never prevail,” Wang said. “China urges New Zealand to immediately redress its mistake, and stop all forms of interference in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs, to avoid harming China-New Zealand relations.”

A Brexit hit is looming for sectors that have emerged relatively unscathed from the Covid-19 pandemic, analysis by the London School of Economics suggests.
The LSE report says Brexit will deliver a double shock to the economy – with business conditions worsening for those sectors that have survived the impact of coronavirus and lockdown measures – whether Boris Johnson secures a deal with the EU or not.
The analysis, seen by the Guardian before its publication on Wednesday, includes information from a monthly survey of Confederation of British Industry members.
“Our analysis shows that the sectors that will be affected by Brexit and those that are suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown are generally different from each other,” said Swati Dhingra, an economics professor who co-authored the report.
A “simultaneous impact” from Brexit and coronavirus will be felt across the business spectrum from the autumn when the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s pandemic policies aimed at supporting the unemployed end and the new trading environment for the UK outside the EU begins to bite, the research finds.

The report, Covid-19 and Brexit: Real-Time Updates on Business Performance in the United Kingdom by the LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance, shows sectors that entail more human contact – including hospitality, air travel, restaurants, hotels, and arts and entertainment – have been the hardest hit by the pandemic.
The affect on other sectors such as the scientific industries, professional services, including accountancy and legal services, and publishing has been less severe because they can continue to operate with staff working from home.
Among those reportedly continuing to operate with remote working are firms such as Vodafone, Google, the accountancy firm KPMG, GlaxoSmithKline, Rolls-Royce and the consumer goods group Unilever.

But Brexit will impose barriers on those trading goods or services with the EU, whether it is pharmaceutical companies seeking regulatory approval, banks or services needing to transfer data from servers in the bloc or car manufacturers or clothes importers being required to fill in customs declarations for the first time in decades.
The report points out that as far back as 2017 the government announced that Brexit would be guided by impact assessments across sectors; it has provided detailed analysis in only 10 sectors to date.
“The government must move beyond its broad assessment of Brexit impacts to much more finely tuned plans” in preparation for the “biggest slowdown of our lifetime” said Josh de Lyon, a research assistant at the LSE centre who co-authored the report.
Dhingra said the coronavirus pandemic had “reduced the capacity of the UK economy to take further shocks”, and “rushing Brexit through” would “broaden the set of sectors” that experienced worsening business conditions.
Using monthly data collected by the CBI on business experiences and expectations of growth or declines, along with what it describes as “state of the art” modelling, the centre has been able to assess the outlook for the next three months.
LSE, like other big institutions, is loath to put a figure on the projected combined shock to the economy although various sectors have warned of hardship coming down the tracks. The manufacturing body Make UK warned that more than half of the manufacturing sector was planning redundancies when the business support schemes ended.
The LSE report urges the government to put in place an industrial strategy that “must reflect” the cold reality of “being in a post-Brexit UK which is placed in a post-Covid world economy” in which global trade shrinks.

Many of us have found ourselves dressing differently during lockdown. Perhaps you previously wore a suit to the office but are now opting for something more relaxed while working from home. Or maybe you used to get dressed up to go out on the town, but haven’t ventured further than your back garden lately?
Has lockdown made you ditch your jeans, or invest in luxury loungewear? Are waistbands and lace-up shoes a thing of your fashion past – or, on the other hand, have you been striving for normality by wearing your Sunday best to the supermarket? Either way, we want to know about your newly formed fashion habits, why you’ve made changes, and if you think they’ll stick as lockdown begins to ease.

The former boss of French car giant Renault has been appointed as chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s biggest carmaker.
Thierry Bolloré, who said he was the subject of a “strong-arm coup” when he was ousted as Renault chief executive in October 2019, will take over from Sir Ralf Speth as JLR’s CEO in September.
Bolloré, 57, will be tasked with guiding JLR through the car industry’s worst crisis in living memory as consumer demand for new cars plummeted amid the global economic crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chairman of India’s Tata conglomerate, which owns JLR, said: “I am delighted to welcome Thierry to Jaguar Land Rover. An established global business leader with a proven track record of implementing complex transformations, Thierry will bring a wealth of experience to one of the most revered positions in the industry.”
Bolloré said: “Jaguar Land Rover is known around the world for its peerless brand heritage, exquisite design and deep engineering integrity. It will be my privilege to lead this fantastic company through what continues to be the most testing time of our generation.
“Renowned for their passion and spirit, the people of Jaguar Land Rover are the driving force behind its success. I couldn’t be more excited to join the team continuing to shape the future of this iconic company.”
Bolloré was ousted from Renault after less than a year in the top job as the French carmaker sought “a breath of fresh air” following the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, its former boss, in a huge financial scandal in Japan. Ghosn presided over the global alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.

At the time of his ousting in October, Bolloré, once a close associate of Ghosn, told the French business paper Les Echos that the “brutality and the totally unexpected nature of what is happening are staggering”.
“Operationally, I do not see where the fault is,” he said. “This coup is very worrying”.
Speth, 64, who has been chief executive of JLR for a decade, will become non-executive vice chairman.
Chandrasekaran said: “I want to thank Ralf for a decade of outstanding vision and leadership for Jaguar Land Rover and welcome him to his new non-executive position in addition to his existing role on the board of Tata Sons.”

Former San Francisco 49er Dana Stubblefield was convicted on Monday of the rape of a developmentally disabled woman, after prosecutors said he lured the victim to his home with the promise of a babysitting job.
A jury found Stubblefield, 49, guilty of rape by force, oral copulation by force and false imprisonment, and acquitted him of raping a person incapable of giving consent, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
Jurors also found that Stubblefield used a gun during the assault, prosecutors said.
Stubblefield could face 15 years to life in prison. He was a defensive lineman for the San Francisco 49ers and the Oakland Raiders.
The verdict came after a nine-month trial, and five years after the victim reported the April 2015 sexual assault to police, the newspaper said.
A day before the assault, Stubblefield contacted the then 31-year-old woman on a babysitting website and arranged an interview, prosecutors said.
According to a report by the Morgan Hill police department, the interview lasted about 20 minutes. She later received a text from Stubblefield saying he wanted to pay her for her time that day, and she went back to the house.
After raping her, Stubblefield gave her $80 and let her go, according to the report. The woman immediately went to police and reported the rape. DNA evidence matched that of Stubblefield, the report said.
Defense attorneys argued that there was no rape and that the woman consented to sex.
Allen Sawyer, one of Stubblefield’s trial attorneys, described the incident as a “paid encounter for sex.” He said the defense team was precluded from showing the jury strong evidence that would have supported the contention.
“There’s a lot of information that we have, that the jury was not allowed to have, that we think would have been impactful to their decision,” Sawyer told the Chronicle on Monday after the verdict was read. 
Sawyer said defense attorneys will seek a new trial.
“We expect to keep fighting for Mr Stubblefield’s innocence,” Sawyer said. “We will clear his name, and we look forward to fighting this out in the courts. This is just the first battle.”
Stubblefield was remanded to jail without bail, pending sentencing.
Stubblefield was drafted by the 49ers in 1993 and named to the NFL All-Pro team from 1994 through 1997. He spent the next three seasons with Washington, then played two more years with the 49ers and a final season with the Raiders before retiring at the start of the 2004 season.
In his final season, the NFL fined Stubblefield and three other Raiders for testing positive for steroids. In 2009, a federal judge fined him $5,000 and placed him on two years’ probation for lying to an IRS agent about his steroid use, the Chronicle said.

Malaysia’s former prime minister Najib Razak has been found guilty of all seven charges in his first trial linked to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal – a landmark conviction that means he now faces 12 years in jail.
Najib has denied any wrongdoing in relation to what is one of the world’s biggest financial frauds, in which billions of dollars were allegedly looted from a state fund set up to promote development. The scandal shook Malaysian politics, led to the ousting of Najib’s Umno party after 61 years in power, and prompted a series of investigations in countries around the world.


 Quick guide What is the 1MDB scandal?  


 Show 


 Hide  




What was 1MDB?

1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) was an investment fund created in 2009 by former prime minister Najib Razak with a laudable aim: to finance the development of Malaysia and help its poorest people. The fund leveraged Malaysia’s reputation as a fast-growing ""tiger economy"" to raise debt to fund infrastructure.



What went wrong?

Between 2009 and at least 2014 the fund became a vehicle for government officials to steal an alleged $4.5bn (£3.5bn) and launder the proceeds. Instead of funding projects for Malaysia’s poorest, the money was spent on luxury property in the US and elsewhere, including London, and used to pay gambling expenses at Las Vegas casinos.
The alleged thieves also acquired artwork worth more than $200m such as paintings by Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet, bought lavish gifts for their family and friends and even invested in Hollywood productions, such as Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-nominated The Wolf of Wall Street – itself a story of investment fraud.



Who was involved?

The scandal reached the very highest political circles, with Najib accused of receiving $681m in his personal accounts. Najib, ousted in an election 2018, denies all wrongdoing. He was found guilty on 28 July 2020 of all seven charges in his first trial linked to the scandal.
Najib’s wife, Rosmah Mansor, and stepson, Riza Aziz, were also charged in the case, but prosecutors recently dropped charges against Aziz following a heavily criticised settlement.
One of the key figures in the fraud was Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, a Malaysian financier with no formal link to 1MDB but who is alleged to have been a mastermind behind its looting. Low is a fugitive, with reports he may be living in China.
On 24 July 2020, Goldman Sachs reached a $3.9bn settlement, in return for Malaysia dropping criminal charges against the investment bank over its role in helping 1MDB sell $6.5bn in bonds.

Thank you for your feedback.




On Tuesday morning, almost 16 months since the start of the trial, Kuala Lumpur high court judge Mohamad Nazlan Mohamad Ghazali sentenced Najib to 12 years in prison and a fine of RM210m £39m).
“After considering all evidence in this trial, I find that the prosecution has successfully proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt,” he told the court. The court allowed a stay of the jail sentence and fine, which means Najib will not be sent to prison immediately.
Najib, whose legal team had sought to delay the sentencing, asked for leniency. Speaking from the dock, he told of his successes as a leader and swore that he wasn’t aware of vast funds that had been transferred into his account.
Dr Muhammad Mohan, President of Transparency International Malaysia, welcomed the verdict, which he said would “boost confidence in the judiciary system and rule of law” for many. But he added: “There could be a group who feel that, because [Najib] can appeal, anything can happen.”
Writing on Facebook on Monday evening, Najib vowed to fight a possible guilty verdict:  “From day one, I have said this is the chance for me to clear my name … Whatever the decision in the high court tomorrow, it does not end here ... after this, we will go to the court of appeal. I am ready.”
In total, Najib faces five separate trials linked to the scandal. Tuesday’s verdict relates to seven charges over the transfer of 42m ringgit (£7.7m) from former 1MDB unit SRC International into Najib’s bank accounts through intermediary companies. He could face hefty fines and up to 20 years in jail for each charge.
During the trial, the court heard of Najib’s lavish spending sprees, including how, on one occasion, he spent £620,000 at a jeweller in Italy in a single day and, months later£84,000 at a Chanel boutique in Hawaii.
Najib defended the credit card spending as purchases for official purposes. He had pleaded not guilty to criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power.
Najib testified that he was misled by the Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials into believing the funds had been donated by the Saudi royal family and not misappropriated from SRC, as prosecutors allege. Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said in 2016 the funds were “a genuine donation”, but the government has not commented on the case since. Low denies any wrongdoing.
Speaking to the Guardian before the verdict, Bridget Welsh, an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham’s Asia Research Institute Malaysia, said: “People will be watching carefully because they know that Malaysia’s reputation was damaged by 1MDB, and I think they are looking to this case to hope that this is going to restore Malaysia’s reputation.”

A not-guilty verdict would have been seen as “a miscarriage of justice on the part of many Malaysians”, said Welsh, but she added that the political situation in Malaysia was polarised, and that attitudes towards the verdict would reflect this.
The judgment has major implications for the country’s leadership. Less than two years after being removed from government over the corruption scandal, Umno returned to power again in March, through an alliance led by the prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin. Some have questioned whether this change in leadership would have ramifications for ongoing corruption cases.
A not-guilty verdict could have paved the way for Najib to run again for office. The conviction, however, could weaken Muhyiddin’s coalition, which depends on Umno for support.
Despite Tuesday’s verdict, Najib is likely to continue to play a role in politics from behind the scenes. “He may not be able to run for office, but he will still have power within the political party,” said Welsh.

In total, the US justice department believes more than £3.5bn was stolen from the 1MDB fund and laundered by Najib’s associates. More than £540m from the fund allegedly landed in Najib’s bank accounts. Najib’s wife and several officials from his party and previous government have also been charged with graft. They deny any wrongdoing.
Muhyiddin has said he will introduce anti-corruption reforms. A recent decision to drop charges against Najib’s stepson, Riza Aziz, the producer of The Wolf of Wall Street, in a settlement deal, has been criticised by activists.
Last week, Goldman Sachs reached a £3bn settlement, in return for Malaysia dropping criminal charges against the investment bank over its role in helping 1MDB sell £5bn in bonds.

The Conservative backbencher Sir Desmond Swayne says that the requirement for shoppers to wear face masks is a “monstrous imposition”, but covering our faces need not feel so restrictive. Masks protect shopkeepers – who can be up to 75% more likely to die of coronavirus than the general population – and there is no reason they cannot be stylish.
If you live in the UK, we want to see the face coverings you have made at home. How did you design and build them? Which materials did you use? Whether you cut up an old T-shirt or spent hours labouring over a sewing machine, we want to see the results. We also want to hear how you feel about your mask. Do you feel more safe and responsible while wearing it and do you agree with the government’s policy on shops and public transport?

Face coverings: show us your homemade masks

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s 23 July address to the House of Representatives was a welcome reminder of what political speech can be: eloquent, lucid, truthful, intelligent, moving and persuasive. It also made you aware of how low public discourse has sunk. From both sides of the aisle, we hear soundbites, attacks, promises that vanish before the ink dries, reasons the rich should prosper while the poor stay poor. We’ve learned to accept the word salad – rambling, digressive, inarticulate, salted with evasions, distortions and lies – we’re served whenever Trump comes to the table.
By contrast, Ocasio-Cortez’s address was a masterpiece of heartfelt, unadorned plain speech that (consciously or instinctively) employed the tools of the orator, the rhetorician and preacher. What carries us is repetition, rhythm, emphasis, cadence, pronunciation (the congresswoman leans into her Bronx vowels) and a seamless transition from each event or idea to its larger implications.
Walking up the steps of the US Capitol building, the congresswoman, as she tells it, was “minding my own business” when she was “accosted” by Representative Ted Yoho, a Republican from Florida, who “put his finger in my face … He called me disgusting, he called me crazy, he called me out of my mind, he called me dangerous.” Then she went into the building to vote, to make sure, she adds, that her constituents from New York’s 14th district can keep their homes, feed their families and live with dignity.
When she reappeared on the steps, Yoho, in front of the press, called her, “and I quote, ‘a fucking bitch’.”
It’s worth watching the video to see how Ocasio-Cortez, without particular outrage or emotion, pronounces three words that explode like smart bombs in the decorous House. The insult is horrifying, but she’s not all that horrified. Because she’s had working-class jobs, she’s heard it before. She’s “tossed men out of bars”. So she’s not some fragile flower – read female – who can’t take the rough and tumble of Capitol Hill. Yoho’s abuse was neither “deeply hurtful” nor “piercing” to her, though she notes that his behavior was not an isolated event but part of a “culture of impunity” that accepts “violence and violent language against women”. By saying it in front of a reporter, he was giving other men “permission” to do the same.
It’s too bad this had to happen, but I, for one, am glad that “fucking bitch” has been entered – for the first time, I assume – into the Congressional Record. As hateful as those words are, they alone can express the nastiness, rage and contempt that are heavily diluted when the insult is euphemized into “a vulgar slur” or (as Yoho’s spokesman sweetly described it) “a barnyard epithet”.
Meanwhile Ocasio-Cortez’s speech takes another turn. She’d been ready to let the incident go, “pack it up and go home – It’s just another day, right?” But what drove her to speak up were the excuses Yoho gave Congress, insisting that it was all a “misunderstanding”, that “having been married for 45 years with two daughters, I’m very cognizant of my language”.
In a few rhythmic sentences, Ocasio-Cortez pulverizes the “daughter defense” – the suggestion, made by men including Brett Kavanaugh and Mitch McConnell, that having female children automatically makes them more sensitive and respectful to women.
“And this I could not allow … I could not allow the victims of verbal abuse, and worse to see that – to see that excuse and see our Congress accept it as legitimate. I do have issue with using women, our wives and daughters as shields, as excuses for poor behavior. I am someone’s daughter too. I am their daughter, and they did not raise me to accept abuse from men.”
“Having a daughter does not make a man decent. Having a wife does not make a decent man. Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man.”
That resonant word, decent, may remind some listeners of how the chief counsel for the US army, Joseph N Welch, began the downfall of the destructive and despotic Senator Joseph McCarthy by asking the famous question, “Have you no sense of decency?”




 

She’s different from what we’re used to hearing. She makes us pay attention


Ocasio-Cortez ends her speech with more repetitions (accost … without remorse) and variations as she thanks Representative Yoho and brings us full circle back to the Capitol steps. “I want to thank him for showing the world that you can be a powerful man and accost women. You can have daughters and accost women without remorse. You can take photos and project an image to the world of being a family man and accost women without remorse and with a sense of impunity. It happens every day in this country. It happened here on the steps of our nation’s Capitol. It happens when individuals who hold the highest office in this land admit, admit to hurting women, and using this language against all of us.”
In rhetoric, the name for the repetition of an opening phrase is anaphora, and if you Google the word, several sites direct you to Marin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech. I’m not suggesting that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez comes anywhere near MLK’s oratorical powers, but she’s on her way. She’s different from what we’re used to hearing. She makes us pay attention. With her tone, word choice, posture, her honesty, she makes it clear (in case it needs clarification) that women are as articulate, intelligent and brave as any man. Women have been accused of being irrational but the logic of Ocasio-Cortez’s speech proves (in case it needs proving) that women are as cool-headed as any man, certainly more than Yoho.
If, in the future, there are public speaking classes, students might study Ocasio-Cortez’s speech, which has been widely tweeted, viewed on YouTube and other social media. At least 10 of those views are mine. This was partly because she was speaking for me and every woman who has ever been called a fucking bitch. But I also kept watching because, as someone who, to quote Yoho’s sad, stiffly awkward phrase, is “cognizant of language”, I wanted to watch the congresswoman’s speech and try to figure out how she did it.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's eloquence in the face of arrogance is a master class

Crackling down a phone line from Los Angeles, Jon Hassell apologises in advance. Now 83, the multi-instrumentalist and composer – a hero of Brian Eno, Björk, Bono, Jean-Michel Basquiat and others – fell in his recording studio earlier this year, breaking his leg. The subsequent recuperation in a convalescent hospital went on for four months. He had no visitors, due to the coronavirus pandemic, “so I only had my cell phone to maintain contact with the outside world”.
It is an experience that has had after-effects. “I’m feeling a little bird-out-of-cage-like,” he says. “I’ve just got a new apartment and I’m sitting here looking at all the things I’ve brought out of storage yesterday. The place is full of stuff and I have to dig through a lot of things now. And that kind of includes my memory,” he adds, referring to our conversation. “You might hear me searching for really polished answers. But let’s give it a try.”
He really does not need to apologise. He occasionally pauses after I ask a question – “Now, let me see …” – and occasionally returns to a subject some time after I assume we are done with it, but Hassell is a fascinating interviewee, with an astonishingly rich history and umpteen intriguing theories about music.

His most recent is what he calls “pentimento”, a term he borrowed from painting that refers to images and forms that have been painted over in a finished work. He has applied the idea to music on his latest album, Seeing Through Sound, and its 2018 predecessor, Listening to Pictures: they are dense, shifting sound collages, in which, as he puts it, “layers of corrections are used to effloresce out to something”.
The results are experimental, but enveloping and frequently very beautiful, adjectives you could just as easily apply to the recordings Hassell made in the late 70s and early 80s exploring what he called “fourth world” music, perhaps his most influential idea of all. “A signal to the rest of the world: quit ignoring the incredible beauty of African and Brazilian and Indian music,” he says, attempting to neatly summarise the music on 1977’s Vernal Equinox and Fourth World Vol 1: Possible Musics, his 1980 collaboration with Eno.
They are albums that ideologically, if not sonically, anticipated the global melting pot of modern pop. It is now common for Latin American rhythms or Afrobeats to blend with hip-hop and house, or for a band such as the Texas trio Khruangbin to stir Thai, Mexican and west African influences into a psychedelic “Earth music”. “Just be more aware of the rest of the world,” Hassell advises. “I’m very proud of the fact that it has sort of caught on with young musicians: the degree of awareness these days, because of all the technological possibilities. The fourth world is something that says: I’m aware of that, I’m aware of this and here’s what I’m coming up with.”

raga. Photograph: Chris Young/Redferns


Looking back at Hassell’s career, you can see how he ended up determined to break down boundaries between jazz, modern classical and global music. He was born in Memphis – “I’m proud that I came from the same place as the blues” – but moved first to New York, then Cologne, studying under Karlheinz Stockhausen alongside Holger Czukay and Irmin Schmidt of Can, the latter enlivening their studies by smuggling in LSD from Amsterdam. He attempted to apply Stockhausen’s experiments with cut up and looped tapes to a recording of the Hi-Lo’s, an American jazz vocal group: “They had very advanced harmonies, 13th chords and that kind of thing, and I wanted to see what they sounded like cut up and looped … [the results] were hard to describe verbally”.
On returning to the US, he befriended Robert Moog, who was using his recently invented Moog synthesizer to create “environmental pieces” alongside another friend, the composer Terry Riley. “Terry would do these all-night performances where everyone would end up lying on the floor, listening: very engrossing and immersing; things changing so gradually you didn’t really know they had changed. ‘I was listening to this four minutes ago, now, oh my God, it’s completely different, but I did not experience it.’”
He played trumpet on the first recording of Riley’s minimalist masterpiece In C, worked with La Monte Young’s Theatre of Eternal Music – whose ranks had previously included John Cale and Sterling Morrison of the Velvet Underground – then repaired to India to study under the classical singer Pandit Pran Nath, whom he still describes as his greatest influence. “Any music is an art, but the study of raga, it’s just miraculous; it’s a sonic temple. How you use it and don’t use it is significant. I was using it on the trumpet – not a continuous-stream instrument, right, so I had to learn how to simulate all the ganaks, the ornamentation. You want to use the possibilities and potentialities of the western instrument while not ignoring the shape-making of what raga means. It’s like calligraphy – sonic calligraphy.” Ry Cooder has said Hassell is “one of the three or four players of wind instruments in the world who can command your attention with one note”.
Vernal Equinox was the first fruit of his explorations of non-western music: recently reissued, it sounds astonishingly timeless, perhaps because it was like nothing else released in 1977, Hassell’s trumpet floating through landscapes of electronics, drones and Indian and South American percussion. His fourth world experiments have failed to attract the charge of cultural appropriation, perhaps because he always gave lavish credit to his sources and collaborators: as Eno once wrote, in an essay titled The Debt I Owe To Jon Hassell: “If I had to name one over-riding principle in Jon’s work, it would be that of respect: he looks at the world in all its momentary and evanescent moods with respect, and this shows in his music.”

Hassell was supposed to be the third collaborator on Eno and David Byrne’s seminal My Life In the Bush of Ghosts. However, having contributed “sketches” to the project, he quit early on, unimpressed with what Eno and Byrne had done. His name was removed from the credits of an album that he later protested “came out of me”. Today, he seems philosophical about his forays into the pop world. “It’s a matter of knowing: what is it I really like?” he says. “And then you can either drive it into the ground and get put in an asylum, or you invent something, you make something from that initial spark.”
Given his current medical travails, he is not sure what the rest of his ninth decade has in store. He has his own label, an offshoot of the electronic giant Warp, which is a testimony to his influence on electronic music; he has been sampled by everyone from Ricardo Villalobos to Arca. He vaguely moots plans to resurrect some of the “environmental pieces” that he worked on in the 60s. And he has a book waiting to be published, The North and South of You; it expounds another musical theory, the battle between the intellectual and the Dionysian in art.
“I could never pick up the trumpet again and have fun,” he says. “But I don’t intend to do that anyway.” He chuckles. “I have plans.”

Jon Hassell, music's great globetrotter: 'Be more aware of the rest of the world!'

Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has denied the season is in trouble even though more than a dozen Marlins players and staff have tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting the club to lock down in Philadelphia. Three games have now been postponed due to the outbreak in the Marlins’ locker room.
“I don’t see it as a nightmare,” Manfred told MLB Network on Monday night. “We built the protocols to allow us to continue to play. That’s why we have the expanded rosters, that’s why we have the pool of additional players. And we think we can keep people safe and continue to play.”
Manfred said the soonest the Marlins could resume their schedule is Wednesday, when they are set to play in Baltimore.

“I remain optimistic the protocols are strong enough that it will allow us to continue to play even through an outbreak like this and complete our season,” Manfred said.
The Yankees and Phillies also postponed their game Monday after the Marlins played in Philadelphia over the weekend. As of Monday night, the teams planned to begin their series on Tuesday instead. ESPN reports that no members of the Phillies had tested positive for the coronavirus as of Tuesday morning. 
Manfred was asked what would have to happen for the league to shut down. “A team losing a number of players, making it completely noncompetitive, would be something we would have to address and have to think about making a change,” he said. “Our first concern is the health of the players and their families. And making sure we do everything possible to minimize the spread of the virus to our employees.”
Word of multiple positive tests among players on the Marlins and Reds rosters shook many around the game.
“I’m going to be honest with you: I’m scared,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.
Experts also expressed their concern over the outbreak.
“This could put it in danger,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert during an appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America. “I don’t believe they need to stop, but we just need to follow this and see what happens with other teams on a day-by-day basis.”
Fauci, who threw out the first pitch at the season opener between the Nationals and Yankees, said he was sorry to see the troubles experienced by the league.
“Major League Baseball – the players, the owners, the managers – have put a lot of effort into getting together and putting protocols that we feel would work,” Fauci said. “It’s very unfortunate what happened with the Miami [Marlins].”
Dr Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto, was even more cautious than Fauci. “Baseball is in huge trouble,” he said. “It makes me wonder if they are listening to the advice of experts or whether their experts are giving them good advice. This was not a plan anyone who knows what they are talking about would have conceived. It’s playing out like it was supposed to play out.”

A British-Australian academic serving a 10-year-prison sentence in Iran for espionage has been moved to a remote desert prison, notorious for violence and reportedly stricken with coronavirus.
Cambridge-educated Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a Middle East scholar, had been held in Tehran’s Evin Prison for nearly two years, before her sudden move three days ago to Qarchak women’s prison, south-east of Tehran.
In a phone call with Reza Khandan, the husband of jailed human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, Moore-Gilbert said she felt hopeless and isolated.




'She's not a spy': friends shocked over academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert's jailing in Iran

“I can’t eat anything. I feel so very hopeless,” Moore-Gilbert said, speaking Persian on the call. “I am so depressed. I don’t have any phone card to call. I’ve asked the prison officers but they didn’t give me a phone card. I [was last able to] call my parents about one month ago.”
Moore-Gilbert is reportedly in a quarantine section of the prison for new inmates.
Isolated and overcrowded, Qarchak has a reputation as one of the most hostile prisons in the country. Last month, the US state department listed Qarchak as an entity responsible for “extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights”.
A report by the Human Rights Activists News Agency in March detailed acts of violence, including torture and rape, as well as lack of medical services.
Coronavirus is understood to be present within the prison. Sources say social distancing is impossible, and access to soap is often limited.
Like Evin prison’s Ward 2A, where Moore-Gilbert had been held previously, Qarchak prison is controlled by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The Guardian has confirmed Moore-Gilbert’s move to Qarchak with independent sources inside Iran.
Some have said Qarchak prison is notoriously used to “exile” prisoners considered difficult, or whose cases are acutely potentially sensitive, while other sources said the transfer could be seen as potential movement in her case, and not designed as a punitive measure.
Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Islamic Studies at the University of Melbourne, was arrested in September 2018 after attending an academic conference, at which she was invited to speak, in Qom.
Fellow conference delegates and an interview subject for her academic work flagged her as “suspicious” to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, who arrested her at Tehran airport as she prepared to fly out of the country.
She was convicted in a secret trial and sentenced to 10 years prison on charges of espionage. An appeal failed.
No evidence has ever been publicly presented of Moore-Gilbert’s alleged crimes. She has denied the allegations against her, and the Australian government rejects them as baseless and politically motivated.
A citizen of both the UK and Australia, Moore-Gilbert has been publicly silent for months, since a series of smuggled letters were published earlier this year detailing the privations of her imprisonment, including months isolated in solitary confinement, and a shortage of food, medicine, and money to buy personal items.
“I feel like I am abandoned and forgotten … I am an innocent victim,” she wrote.
She said she had rejected outright an offer to spy for the Iranian government that would have led to her being freed.
“I am not a spy. I have never been a spy and I have no interest in working for a spying organisation in any country. When I leave Iran, I want to be a free woman and live a free life, not under the shadow of extortion and threats.”
Iran has temporarily released more than 100,000 prisoners out of concern Covid-19 could sweep through the country’s overcrowded prisons, but Moore-Gilbert has not been among those released.

Tom Cotton, the Arkansas senator, introduced a bill last week to prohibit federal funds from being used to teach the New York Times’ 1619 Project, which looks at the legacy of slavery in the US, in elementary and secondary schools.
The bill notes that “an activist movement is now gaining momentum to deny or obfuscate [the history of America’s founding] by claiming that America was not founded on the ideals of the Declaration but rather on slavery and oppression.” Cotton later asserted in an interview that “the founding fathers said [slavery]... was the necessary evil upon which the union was built, but the union was built in a way, as [Abraham] Lincoln said, to put slavery on the course to its ultimate extinction”.




Tom Cotton calls slavery 'necessary evil' in attack on New York Times' 1619 Project

So while the founding fathers said the union was “built” on slavery, according to Cotton, he is against the 1619 Project’s position that America was founded on “slavery and oppression”. One could get into the semantic differences between a country “built” on slavery and “founded” on it. But the crux of Cotton’s dispute is that he wants America depicted in a blindingly positive light. This points to a larger issue: conservative resistance to teaching any version of history that upends the myth of American exceptionalism. The power imbalance that has historically censored opposing versions of this mythological America is the real “cancel culture”.
To be clear, some historians across race have taken issue with what they see as inaccuracies in the project. The most contentious claim journalist Nikole Hannah Jones makes in her Pulitzer prize-winning 1619 Project essay is that protecting the brutal institution of slavery was “one of the primary reasons colonists decided to declare their independence from Great Britain”. This portrayal has been challenged by historians. It was also decried by Republicans like Cotton, for whom America was founded on ideals of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”. So who is right? The reality is America was founded on both. And if the 1619 Project’s vehement rightwing critics were paying attention or cared about accuracy as much as they claim, they’d realize Jones acknowledged as much.
Before justifying her argument, Jones states: “the United States is a nation founded on both an ideal and a lie.” Asserting that all men are created equal was a lie, because “one-fifth of the population within the 13 colonies struggled under a brutal system of slavery unlike anything that had existed in the world before”, she continued. This system treated Black people as chattel, and their subjugation was later justified with anti-blackness that has been central to America’s foundation.




 

In the eyes of conservatives like Cotton, a worldview that challenges his idealization of America is a threat to the country itself


From the colonial era to the antebellum years, those with misgivings about slavery didn’t necessarily believe that Black people were equal. Abraham Lincoln was among those pronouncing the “superior position assigned to the white race”. Whatever motivated some colonists to seek British independence is unrelated to the position that America’s founding document was hypocritical. But conservatives like Cotton aren’t looking for a more precise and accurate accounting of American hypocrisy; instead they prefer we largely avoid interrogating America at all. And anyone or anything that falls out of line must be cancelled and excommunicated from the church of American exceptionalism.
Cotton’s bill and accompanying rhetoric, wrapped in the zealous alarm of a religious fundamentalist, give this away. The Project, the bill claims, “threatens the integrity of the Union”, and is revisionist history “at its worst”. If passed, teaching the 1619 Project will cost school districts professional development funds and lower other federal funding to make up for costs associated with “planning time and teaching time” of the Project’s curriculum. It is unclear if this refers to teaching any one of the essays or other creative works of the Project or the entire teaching guide offered by the Pulitzer Center. But censoring the whole Project with a blunt cudgel, instead of addressing its advantages and specific weaknesses, is the point.

In the eyes of conservatives like Cotton, a worldview that challenges his idealization of America is a threat to the country itself. I mean, think about the children! How dare we indoctrinate them with propaganda, as if the propaganda of American exceptionalism has not been central to US K-12 education.
This hyperbole undermines what could be a nuanced discussion of the various principles and practices that have guided the country, including a class analysis that examines distinctions between America’s white, land-owning planter class and everyone else – those enslaved, indentured and colonized across race whose labor and land, in the case of the indigenous, were exploited to advance capitalism.
Beyond that, the bill’s extreme measures belie Republican rhetoric about censorship and “states’ rights”, and they point to the privilege of one version of America – one that upholds American exceptionalism like religious dogma – dominating our curriculum. It is a privilege that allows some powerful white men, from slave-owning founding fathers to senators like Cotton, to depict slavery as in any way necessary and pushback as heretical. And it’s not just obscene for kids; think of the crucifixion of marginalized conservatives targeted by America’s growing “activist movement”. First they come for our Confederate statues and now our warped slavery-justifying bubble, the horror! What’s next? A critique of capitalism? Imperialism? Police?
The Black Lives Matter movement is surely only catalyzing this alarmism, with Cotton’s bill explicitly acknowledging activists’ “growing momentum”. Many conservatives cannot reasonably grapple with increasing radicalism unsatisfied with mere reform and evocation of ideals of American equality. With abolitionist scholars drawing an “unbroken line” from slavery to current policing, to national protests spotlighting the concurrent crises of systemically racist economic and public health systems, America is at a tipping point.
Tom Cotton’s legislation is another example of the same old guard of the Grand Old Party seeking to tip the scales where conservatives have historically weighted them – in the hands of the powerful, white and well-off – and cancelling those who challenge them. Meanwhile, much of the country simply wants equality. And a first step towards actually achieving the ideals its founders’ promised is exposing the fullness of America – its hypocritical promises and oppression among them – in schools and on the streets. Nothing could be more patriotic.

Tom Cotton’s war on the 1619 Project is the real 'cancel culture'

Nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by Australia’s devastating bushfire season of 2019 and 2020, according to scientists who have revealed for the first time the scale of the impact on the country’s native wildlife.
The Guardian has learned that an estimated 143 million mammals, 180 million birds, 51 million frogs and a staggering 2.5 billion reptiles were affected by the fires that burned across the continent. Not all the animals would have been killed by the flames or heat, but scientists say the prospects of survival for those that had withstood the initial impact was “probably not that great” due to the starvation, dehydration and predation by feral animals – mostly cats – that followed.
An interim report based on work by 10 scientists from five institutions, commissioned by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), suggests the toll from the fires goes much further than an earlier estimate of more than 1 billion animals killed.


 Q&A What is the After the Bushfires series?  


 Show 


 Hide  

The wildfires that swept through many parts of Australia between July 2019 and February 2020 were of a scale and size that is difficult to imagine. By the end of February, they had burned through at least 32,000 square miles (85,000 sq km) of Australian forest, an area the size of Ireland. 
Nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by bushfire. The habitat of an estimated 143 million mammals, 180 million birds, 51 million frogs and 2.5 billion reptiles was burned. 
The fires came during Australia's hottest year on record and in a country that already has among the world's highest extinction rates because of invasive non-native species such as cats, foxes, deer, horses and various pathogens, along with habitat clearing and fragmentation.
But one year on from the start of those fires, what does the landscape look like today? With state borders closing because of Covid-19, the Guardian took a virtual journey through the blackened path of Australia’s summer of bushfires, talking to those who are investigating  the state of the continent’s surviving flora and fauna.

Scientists from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, University of Newcastle, Charles Sturt University and Birdlife Australia contributed to the study.
Dermot O’Gorman, WWF-Australia’s chief executive, said: “It’s hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history.”
Chris Dickman, a professor in ecology at the University of Sydney and fellow of the Australian Academy of Science who oversaw the project, said its central finding was a shock even to the researchers. “Three thousand million native vertebrates is just huge. It’s a number so big that you can’t comprehend it,” he said. “It’s almost half the human population of the planet.”
Dickman said the project showed the impact of the fires was much greater than the devastating loss of koalas, which became the public face of the disaster to international audiences. Many of the reptiles affected were smaller species, such as skinks, that can live in densities of more than 1,500 individuals per hectare.

Lead researcher Lily van Eeden, of the University of Sydney, said the study was the first to attempt a continent-wide assessment of the impact of bushfires on animals. The analysis is based on a burned zone of 11.46m hectares (28.31m acres), an area nearly the size of England. It includes about 8.5m hectares of forest, mostly in the southeast and southwest but including 120,000 hectares of northern rainforest.
The study showed the extent to which megafires were reducing the country’s biodiversity, and underlined the need to address the climate crisis and stop the clearing of land for agriculture and development, said Dickman.
“We really need to start thinking about how we can rein in this demonic genie that’s out of the bottle,” he said, referring to climate change. “We need to be looking at how quickly can we decarbonise, how quickly can we stop our manic land-clearing.”

Since the late 1980s Australian scientists have been warning that adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere would increase bushfire risk. An analysis in March found the risk of the kind of hot and dry conditions that helped drive Australia’s catastrophic fires had increased by a factor of more than four since 1900, and would be eight times more likely if global heating above pre-industrial levels reached 2C.
In evidence to a royal commission into the bushfires in May, the Australian meteorology bureau presented data showing dangerous fire weather in southeast New South Wales and Victoria was now starting in August, three months earlier than in the 1950s.

The WWF-backed analysis is the latest of several papers to map the devastating impact of the bushfires.
A peer-reviewed study by three ecology professors in June concluded that the fires had caused “the most dramatic loss of habitat for threatened species and devastation of ecological communities in postcolonial history”. This month a separate paper drawing on the work of more than 20 leading Australian scientists found that 49 native species not currently listed as threatened could now be at risk, while government data suggested 471 plant and 191 invertebrate species needed urgent attention.
The WWF report says several techniques were used to estimate animal numbers. Mammal numbers were based on published data on the densities of each species in different areas; bird numbers were derived from BirdLife Australia data based on nearly 104,000 standardised surveys; reptile estimates were modelled using knowledge of environmental conditions, body size and a global database of reptile densities.
The scientists said their estimates were conservative due to limitations in the methodologies used. The number of invertebrates, fish and turtles affected was not estimated due to a lack of relevant data. A final report is due next month.
Several scientists have called for an overhaul of threatened species protection in the wake of the bushfires, including better monitoring of biodiversity. Conservationists have linked Australia’s limited monitoring of its wildlife to a funding for environment programmes being cut by more than a third since the conservative Coalition government was elected in 2013.
O’Gorman said the report should be considered as part of an ongoing independent review of Australia’s national environment laws. “Following such a heavy toll on Australia’s wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important,” he said.

An interim report from the review released last week said the country was losing biodiversity at an alarming rate and had one of the highest rates of extinction in the world. It said existing laws were not fit to address current or future environmental challenges.
Scott Morrison’s government responded by announcing it would introduce new national environmental standards against which major development approvals would be judged. But the government has been criticised for pushing to change the laws to allow it to devolve approval decisions to state and territory governments before completion of the review and before the new standards were ready to improve biodiversity protection.

Almost 3 billion animals affected by Australian bushfires, report shows

Helen Mirren, Shia LaBeouf and Greta Thunberg are among the big names due to be on display at the 2020 Venice film festival, as it gears up to be the first major festival to stage a physical event in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Inevitably the lineup has a slimmed-down feel, with many films delayed or held back, meaning there is little in the way of Venice’s traditional dose of Hollywood glamour.
Festival director Alberto Barbera announced the main list of titles on Tuesday, which drew together films by the likes of Alex Gibney, Chloé Zhao and Luca Guadagnino. Zhao’s film, Nomadland, is arguably the most prized: following her indie hit The Rider, Zhao has adapted Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction account of older Americans forced on to the road by economic crisis, with Frances McDormand acting as producer as well as taking the lead role. In a sign of the pressures on film festivals, Nomadland will simultaneously premiere at the Toronto film festival, as well as subsequently filling the prestigious Centrepiece screening at the New York film festival.
While American studio product is thin on the ground, a string of international auteurs have had their films selected, including veteran Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky, Israeli film-maker Amos Gitai, and previous Golden Lion winner Gianfranco Rosi. Call Me By Your Name director Guadagnino will bring Salvatore: Shoemaker of Dreams, a documentary about Salvatore Ferragamo, the founder of the celebrated shoe brand, and Gibney’s film is Crazy, Not Insane, a profile of Dorothy Otnow Lewis, a pioneering forensic psychiatrist and serial-killer investigator. Thunberg is the subject of another documentary, Greta, directed by Nathan Grossman.

The British contribution is led by The Duke, directed by Notting Hill’s Roger Michell, which stars Jim Broadbent and Mirren in a story inspired by the real-life theft of Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington from London’s National Gallery in 1961. Nowhere Special, which stars James Norton as a window-cleaner in Belfast and is directed by The Full Monty producer Uberto Pasolini, has been selected for the Orizzonti section, while Final Account, a decade-in-the-making documentary collecting testimonies from Holocaust perpetrators is screening out of competition after the death of its director Luke Holland.
The festival is expected to go ahead with reduced numbers of delegates and social distancing protocols in place, as well as more screenings in outdoor venues. The associated film market will move online, as will the festival’s ambitious virtual reality competition, which has operated since 2017 on Venice’s Lazzaretto Vecchio island.

In previous years, much criticism has been directed at Venice for its seeming inability to select significant numbers of female directors, with two included in the 2019 competition and one in 2018. This year, in contrast, Barbera has named eight films (out of 18) with female directors that will compete for the Golden Lion, including Zhao, French director Nicole Garcia and US-based Norwegian film-maker Mona Fastvold.
The festival is also due to give life achievement Golden Lions to veteran Hong Kong actor-director Ann Hui and British actor Tilda Swinton, while Cate Blanchett has been installed as competition jury president.
The Venice film festival runs from 2-12 September.

Venice becomes first major film festival to return after coronavirus lockdown
",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/28/venice-2020-becomes-first-major-film-festival-to-return-after-coronavirus-lockdown
"
The recipe
Wash 150g of brown basmati rice in a bowl of deep water. (I do this three times, some might say once is enough.) Put the rice in a medium-sized saucepan, cover it with twice the volume of water and bring to the boil. Add half a teaspoon of salt, 6 black peppercorns and a couple of bay leaves and cover with a lid, lowering the heat so the water simmers gently. Leave for 15 minutes, or until the rice is as you like it, then remove from the heat and set aside, still covered, for 10 minutes.




 

The tomatoes provide a sweet-sharp sauce to which you can add almost anything you like


Cut 2 small to medium courgettes into 1cm dice. Finely slice 2 medium leeks. Melt 30g of butter in a large frying pan, add 3 tbsp of olive oil and heat until they start to sizzle. Add the courgette, lower the heat, and cook until they start to soften and turn pale gold in colour.
Finely chop the leaves from a couple of bushy sprigs of rosemary and add to the courgette. Fry for a minute or two then stir in the leeks and leave to cook for 7-10 minutes, until the leeks have softened.
Chop 3 medium tomatoes and scatter among the vegetables, cover with a lid and leave to cook for 2-3 minutes. Season with salt, quite generously with black pepper and a generous squeeze of lemon.
Run a fork through the rice to separate the grains, then fold into the vegetables and serve. Enough for 2.
The trick
I like the inherent chewy quality of brown rice, especially when the juices from a vegetable stew such as this trickle through the grains. It takes a little longer than white rice to cook, but not as much as is often suggested. I would normally recommend not to lift the lid from a pot of cooking rice to check its progress, but as brown rice is generally more variable, it is worth checking regularly after the first 10 minutes.
The twist
I do this sort of impromptu “stew” most often in summer. The tomatoes provide a sweet-sharp sauce to which you can add almost anything you like. Steamed French beans or broad beans; peas or pencil-thin carrots; young, steamed beetroot or small summer turnips will all work. Basil leaves are a favourite addition, as are young leaves and flower of thyme. A scattering of mint is something to think about, as is the addition of a bunch of washed and shredded spinach at the very end.

Nigel Slater’s recipe for brown basmati, courgettes and tomatoes

Animal welfare groups have warned that an upcoming shipment of young bulls from Ireland to Libya could contravene live export laws.
The shipment, which is expected to consist of 2,000 bulls, would be the fourth this year from Ireland. It is set to leave on Wednesday next week from the port of Cork in south-west Ireland. Previous shipments of livestock have arrived in the Libyan port of Misrata.
The news comes as a European parliament committee of inquiry, announced last month, begins to look into alleged failures to enforce EU rules on protecting transported animals across the EU and beyond, and “to act upon the evidence that EU rules on moving live animals across the EU and to third countries are being seriously and systematically infringed”.
NGOs objected to live animal exports to Libya in a recent letter to the European commission and EU agriculture council. The country has been in chaos since the Arab spring uprisings and a Nato bombing campaign that toppled its leader, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011.

Animals have died on previous shipments to Libya from Ireland, a voyage of about nine days. Caroline Rowley, founder of Irish welfare organisation Ethical Farming Ireland, said she believed the Libya shipments breached several regulations including (EC) No 1/2005, which covers the protection of animals during transport and related operations, the European  communities (protection of  animals  during  transport)  regulations 2006 and Ireland’s 2013. Animal Health and Welfare Act. All say animals must not be treated or transported in a way likely to cause injury or unnecessary suffering.
“Sending livestock on a long sea journey, where there will be illness, injuries and fatalities, to a country in a state of chaos and lawlessness is unacceptable,” Rowley said.
Olga Kikou, head of Compassion in World Farming EU, said the shipment also appeared to contravene the  treaty on the  functioning of the EU, with regard to welfare and the security situation in Libya.
The treaty states that “since animals are sentient beings” full regard must be paid to their welfare requirements “while respecting the legislative or administrative provisions and customs of the member states”.
“The EU should not be sending animals to war zones, it would be impossible to guarantee even the most basic level of protection there. This cannot happen for humans, and it is certain that for animals it would be even worse,” Kikou said.
Ireland has exported a reported 5,647 cattle to Libya this year, up from 4,211 in the same period last year. The total for 2019 was 13,122 animals.
The Irish government says live export within the EU and beyond is a “vital component” of its livestock industry, increasing competition and boosting animal prices. The latest available figures show live exports earned the country more than €458m (£417m) in 2019.
Responding to the claims its live exports to Libya breached regulations, Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) said in an email it was “satisfied that exports are not in contravention of Article 13 and that journeys certified for export are done in compliance with EU legislation” and in “full compliance with the legislative requirements of EU Regulation No 1 of 2005”.
The DAFM email added that the mortality rate over the three previous shipments to Libya this year was 0.19% and said the date of the upcoming shipment had already been delayed to “late next week dependant on several factors including weather conditions”.

British travellers: how have you been affected by the Spain quarantine decision?

Best player
Ed Aarons: The performances of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Sadio Mané and Jordan Henderson were crucial for a brilliant Liverpool team that left Manchester City floundering in their wake but Virgil van Dijk held it all together. An inspirational leader in a team inspired by their manager’s vision.
Nick Ames: Kevin De Bruyne, Henderson, Mané and Alexander-Arnold are all up there. But Danny Ings’s achievement in scoring 22 goals, while also becoming one of the league’s best all-round strikers, cannot be overstated. The idea would have seemed a fantasy during almost two years spent on the sidelines with knee problems at Liverpool.
Simon Burnton: De Bruyne. The man is just a joy to watch.
Paul Doyle: Raúl Jiménez. The Premier League’s most complete striker is a delight, and not only when combining with the wonderful Adama Traoré. The Mexican scores all kinds of goals – from the scruffy to the sublime – yet is utterly selfless.

Ben Fisher: Mané. Jürgen Klopp’s first major signing has played an influential role at the club, especially in the past couple of trophy-winning seasons. The exhilarating forward’s acceleration, agility and knack for popping up in the right place have created a wicked cocktail for defences. Jamie Vardy, Ings and Jiménez have equally been immense.
Barry Glendenning: Alexander-Arnold’s reinvention of the full-back role and ongoing evolution as a consistently excellent performer despite his tender years remain a joy to behold.
Andy Hunter: Mané. Henderson is a worthy recipient of the FWA footballer of the year award for leading by example on and off the pitch but, by the simple definition of ‘best player’, it is Mané for me. Exhilarating and decisive throughout Liverpool’s title-winning campaign.
David Hytner: It has to be a Liverpool player because of what they have achieved so I’ll go for Mané, who has made the difference many times and been so thrilling to watch.
Jamie Jackson: De Bruyne. Bruno Fernandes (in half a season) comes close but the Belgian has been a tour de force of midfield play all term.
Jonathan Liew: Van Dijk. The key player in the best team. Liverpool’s entire system depends on pouring bodies forward, secure in the knowledge if they get countered Van Dijk will bail them out. Without his presence, aerial dominance, one-on-one ability and playmaking, none of the other stuff works.
Paul MacInnes: Marcus Rashford. Substantially increased his goal tally despite moving out wide, recovered from serious injury to become a crucial part of Manchester United’s late resurgence and provided that wow factor on the pitch. But in a year like no other Rashford stands out for what he did off the field, making the feeding of children from poorer families a national priority, even among the government. Footballers aren’t role models by default, but this is what it looks like when a player becomes one.
Scott Murray: Mané, whose sharp, disruptive brilliance makes chaos out of order and gives Liverpool an extra lock-picking dimension. He also chips in with an absurd number of important goals.
Sachin Nakrani: Henderson. Stitched everything together for the champions with his leadership, desire, energy and, yes, ability. The cool kids may not want to hear it but Henderson is an excellent midfielder, quite old-fashioned in how he can do a little bit of everything, which this season even included setting up a fund for the NHS.
Jacob Steinberg: Alexander-Arnold’s hopes of redefining the right-back role did not seem so ridiculous after he contributed his 13th assist of a wonderful campaign during Liverpool’s 5-3 win over Chelsea last week, breaking the record he set for defenders last season. The 21-year-old is clearly far more than a very good defender. He is a generational talent, blessed with a right foot that evokes memories of David Beckham’s. Those crosses and free-kicks are potent.
Louise Taylor: John Egan. I’m using a wider definition of best than some. The Sheffield United player is no De Bruyne but he has been consistently excellent as the holding defender flanked by two overlapping centre-halves in Chris Wilder’s back-three. The Irishman was, foolishly, shown the door by Sunderland after suffering a leg break on loan at Bradford which necessitated complex surgery, and he ended up at Gillingham. Hats off to their manager at time, Peter Taylor, who nurtured Egan’s talent before moves to Brentford and then Sheffield United.

Best manager
EA: Jürgen Klopp. There is a reason everything runs like clockwork almost every time Liverpool play and it is because every player knows exactly what he is meant to be doing. Recovering from the disappointment of missing out to City last season and guiding Liverpool to the title 30 years on from their previous one ranks as one of the greatest managerial achievements of the modern era.
NA: If Leicester had held on to a top-four spot it might have been Brendan Rodgers, who should still take plenty of credit. In the event, the scale of Klopp’s achievement goes without saying and there are other candidates just behind him. Very honourable mentions to Chris Wilder, Nuno Espírito Santo, Sean Dyche, Graham Potter, Ralph Hasenhüttl and, for the way Aston Villa clawed it back, Dean Smith.
SB: Wilder is the romantic choice given his achievements at Sheffield United, but Klopp can’t be passed over just because he is a bit obvious. It has been another remarkably impressive season for the team and for him individually.
PD: Smith. Villa were the last team to confirm their participation in the Premier League and had to draft in a dozen new and raw players after winning the Championship play-off. Then they lost the spine of their team to injury. Smith used lockdown to tighten up the way they played and secure survival. Top management.
BF: Wilder. A top-half finish with a modest squad is an extraordinary achievement for Sheffield United, who have given Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham bloody noses along the way. Dyche continues to work wonders with a small squad at Burnley and Nuno has superbly led a Wolves team whose season started 12 months ago.
BG: A toss-up between Klopp and Wilder, whose respective achievements at Liverpool and Sheffield United were stunning. Klopp, but only by a whisker.
AH: Klopp showed more shrewd judgment last summer when investing faith in his Champions League-winning squad rather than money on signings. Produced a truly outstanding Premier League champion and, what’s more, deflected the pressure of a 30-year wait throughout their demolition job.

DH: Klopp. No explanation necessary.
JJ: Wilder. In a first year back in the big league Sheffield United finished ninth. An admirable feat.
JL: Wilder. In terms of maximising resources, finding a style that works, building a cohesive unit and not just surviving but also thriving in one of the world’s toughest leagues.
PM: Wilder. Sheffield United are enjoying their greatest success in a generation and Wilder is the man responsible, so that is reason enough. But his tactical acuity, ability to react in matches, to continually get the maximum from his players and rotate his squad judiciously have been on display week in, week out, even after the restart. Plus, he’s a proper character, which should always be encouraged.
SM: Klopp turned doubters into believers, though Hasenhüttl did that too, an entertaining Southampton team with a clear identity emerging from the ruins of that nine-goal debacle. Hats off to his board for staying patient; compare and contrast with their carry-on counterparts at Watford.
SN: Klopp. I was tempted to go for Wilder but ultimately it’s impossible to look past the man who not only ended Liverpool’s long wait for a league title but also made them champions of the world. He did it through force of personality, incredible man-management and something that is often overlooked – tactical nous. A brilliant, all-round manager and without doubt one of the best in Liverpool’s history. Which is saying something.
JS: Wilder did a remarkable job but it cannot be anyone other than Klopp, who deserves immense credit for ensuring Liverpool were able to produce another huge effort after missing out on the title to Manchester City last season. Liverpool’s success was a victory for astute coaching.
LT: Wilder. Comparisons are not so much invidious as impossible given the often vastly differing budgets and contexts but Wilder’s rise from League One to almost qualifying for Europe while introducing overlapping centre-halves and creating an incredible squad camaraderie takes some beating. But then so does Klopp’s achievement in choreographing Liverpool’s jaw-dropping lead over Manchester City. Honourable mentions, too, to Dyche and Newcastle’s Steve Bruce, the latter for confounding a host of doubters including this reporter.
Best goal
EA: Crystal Palace fans are justifiably aggrieved that it didn’t even make Match of the Day’s shortlist because Jordan Ayew conjured up a magical goal that ranks among the best I have seen live to brighten up a dreary Boxing Day game against West Ham at Selhurst Park.
NA: Ayew’s pirouetting solo effort, finished off with a deft chip, against West Ham gets my vote for reasons expanded upon elsewhere. Immaculately planned team goals have their place but nothing beats genius like this.
SB: Tammy Abraham (Watford v Chelsea). Assist of the season, really, though the finish was not too shabby. Jorginho’s pass from the halfway line, though, was of supernatural brilliance.




Premier League 2019-20 review: goals of the season

PD: Jamie Vardy v Arsenal. This simple finish and the devastating sequence of one-touch passes that made it possible stand as testament to how beautiful Leicester can be when at their best
BF: Perhaps not the most obvious choice but Matej Vydra’s goal for Burnley at Southampton in February was a peach. He eliminated one defender, Jack Stephens, by taking a wonderful flighted ball by Jeff Hendrick on his chest before nudging the ball away from another, Kyle Walker-Peters, and lashing a left-foot effort into the top corner. Better still, it was his first goal for 511 days.
BG: Son Heung-min’s slaloming 70-yard solo effort for Tottenham against Burnley – as the old band name sort of goes: And You Will Know Him By The Trail Of Defenders.
AH: Mohamed Salah v Manchester City. A brilliantly executed, difficult team goal made to look simple by the quality of those involved. Sums up this Liverpool team in a way. Trent Alexander-Arnold switches play from right to left with a superb cross-field ball, and with his ‘weaker’ left foot, Andy Robertson controls before delivering a typically inviting cross that Salah heads beyond Claudio Bravo after the ball bounces up at him at pace. Four touches that took Liverpool from their own half to the City net and underlined their superiority over their closest challengers.

DH: Ayew v West Ham. I’m not sure this received the coverage and adulation it deserved. First, the 360-spin away from one defender, then the dart between two more and finally the gloriously composed dinked finish to win the game in the last minute. I remember thinking it would win goal of the season; thanks to Son v Burnley, it didn’t even win goal of the month.
JJ: Bruno Fernandes. ‘Harry Maguire-Nemanja Matic-Mason Greenwood-Fernandes-Goal’ went a sweeping move from the Manchester United area to Brighton’s.
JL: In a disappointing season for great goals, Son against Burnley. The only one of the main contenders to combine technical excellence, physical excellence and positional intelligence.
PM: Son against Burnley. It was like a scene from a Fellini movie, Tottenham’s No 7 pursued by an ever increasing phalanx of Burnley players as he runs the length of the pitch to score. Usually I require a dribbled goal to include a complicated piece of skill to beat a man, but not on this occasion. Son’s goal is pure acceleration, but he does it again, and again, through a team that would happily have brought him down if they could.
SM: Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s bicycle kick, steered in for Brighton against Chelsea on New Year’s Day. An intricately engineered finish, the sort that’s gone a bit out of fashion, with blooters and curlers all the rage right now. Don’t let the fact that Kepa Arrizabalaga was rooted to the spot, as per usual, take anything away from it.
SN: Son v Burnley. I was fortunate enough to be there in December when Son went on a run that started just outside Spurs’ area and saw him surge past seven players before putting the ball into the back of the net with a finish that was as composed as the buildup had been thrilling.
JS: Son showed dazzling quick feet, skill and pace when he scored a brilliant solo goal against Burnley. He started deep in his own half and had the ball seemingly glued to his feet as he went past half the Burnley defence before finishing confidently.
LT: Matty Longstaff v Manchester United. It was early October when Newcastle beat Manchester United 1-0 at St James’ Park courtesy of a fabulous goal from the debut-making 19-year-old central midfielder from nearby North Shields. Struck low, imperiously and unerringly from 25 yards, Longstaff’s winner was stunning in all sorts of senses. An afternoon to remind everyone that sometimes, just sometimes, dreams really do come true.
Best match
EA: Other than Southampton’s revenge mission victory over Leicester a few months after being walloped 9-0 at home it’s quite hard to recall anything from the pre-lockdown world. So I’ll go for Chelsea’s victory over Manchester City at the end of June that meant Liverpool were crowned champions. End-to-end stuff on a dramatic night.
NA: Strictly chosen from those I covered live, plenty of see-sawing affairs played havoc with deadlines at the Emirates. But they were bettered by one further east, at the London Stadium, where West Ham and Brighton fought an error-strewn 3-3 draw that, if lacking in quality, offered full-throttle entertainment for the entire 90 minutes.
PD: Aston Villa 0-0 Sheffield United. In much the same way as rain feels glorious on your first day out of the nick, the return of football after a three-month pox-enforced shutdown felt sweet. And VAR didn’t even muck it up. Oh wait, it did.
BF: Southampton 0-9 Leicester. An ‘I was there’ moment. Horizontal rain, a red card, two hat-tricks and an exhibition in cold finishing.

BG: It wasn’t the most competitive of affairs, but Southampton 0-9 Leicester played in sideways rain on a miserable Friday night at St Mary’s was enjoyably bonkers.
AH: Everton 3-1 Chelsea, 7 December 2019. Everton were in the relegation zone following a 5-2 drubbing at Anfield that signalled the end for Marco Silva and the appointment of a highly emotional Duncan Ferguson for his first game in temporary charge. It could have gone either way against a team of Chelsea’s quality but, with the home side impassioned and Ferguson throwing ballboys in the air, Goodison Park was treated to an all-too-rare demonstration of what could happen if Everton ever assemble a team their fans can identify with.
DH: Chelsea 2-1 Man City. A contest of quality and intensity that transcended the absence of fans and had a pretty major consequence elsewhere.
JJ: Manchester United 1-3 Manchester City, Carabao Cup semi-final. This might have been 7-0 to City by the interval (it was 3-0) before, football being a funny game, United somehow reasserted themselves.
PM: Norwich 3–2 Manchester City. In such an otherwise forgettable season, typical that Norwich should pull off the shock of the year. Late summer, early evening, the sun shone on Carrow Road as Daniel Farke’s side played their way through the back-to-back champions. Some of their football was gorgeous and they were brave off the ball and on it. City were insipid, their performance a harbinger of disappointment to come.
SM: A toss-up between Norwich City 3-2 Manchester City and Watford 3-0 Liverpool, both occasions on which the natural order was given an entertainingly good rattle.
SN: Liverpool 5-3 Chelsea. Lots of goals, lots of great attacking play, swings in momentum, an amusing touchline ruck and the strangest trophy presentation in English football history. The only thing missing from this game was supporters.
JS: Wolves 3-2 Manchester City had it all: VAR controversy, a defiant Raheem Sterling putting 10-man City 2-0 up and Adama Traoré using his outrageous talent to inspire a stunning comeback from Wolves, who showed just how good they are by doing the double over City.
LT: Sheffield United 3-3 Manchester United. Back in that now seemingly far distant old world of late November, the Premier League’s enduring, and enrapturing, dramatic power was encapsulated on a Sunday afternoon in south Yorkshire as Sheffield United cantered into a two-goal lead. Manchester United rallied ferociously with Marcus Rashford putting them 3-2 in front before Oli McBurnie 90th-minute volleyed equaliser very nearly lifted off Bramall Lane’s roof.
Best signing
EA: It’s all about Bruno Fernandes. The Portugal midfielder has finally provided the spark that has been missing at Old Trafford for so long. An honourable mention for Allan Saint-Maximin as well.
NA: You could barely move in January for seeing Fernandes’s name and it was hard not to wonder, when he finally arrived at Old Trafford for £68m, whether he would be worthy of the hype. Big mistake. Fernandes is patently the kind of winning, inspirational force of nature United have missed and he has energised others while settling games himself. Without him, they would have been bobbing along outside the top four.
SB: Everyone will say Fernandes, but only because Fernandes is obviously the right answer. Honourable mentions for Danny Ings, who made his switch to Southampton permanent last summer, and Tomas Soucek, who has made a huge contribution since his arrival at West Ham in January.

PD: Saint-Maximin. If you don’t cheer when watching this guy, you don’t know how to live. Or you’re a defender trying to figure out how to subdue him.
BF: Can we count Ings? A £20m buy for Southampton last summer after spending the previous season on loan there, Ings returned in style, scoring 22 goals – only Vardy scored more – to spearhead the attack with a much-needed swagger. He is lethal in front of goal but his infectious work ethic has proved useful in both boxes. For pure excitement, Saint-Maximin, while Gary Cahill, a free transfer, has been a revelation.
BG: Having failed in their efforts to sign Fernandes last summer, Manchester United finally brought him to Old Trafford in January. His immediate impact has been little short of sensational.
AH: Fernandes. Not exactly cheap or under the radar but a class act who raised the games of those around him and elevated United from mediocrity into Champions League qualifiers.
DH: Fernandes. From the moment he arrived, United have been transformed. Great numbers, great mentality. Can I also give honourable mentions to Gabriel Martinelli and Saint-Maximin?
JJ: Fernandes. What a footballer, what a catalyst. The best post-Alex Ferguson acquisition.
JL: Fernandes. Transformed not just Manchester United’s anaemic midfield, but the whole feel of the club. Arrived shortly after the season’s nadir, a 2-0 defeat to Burnley, and gave them a purpose and a blueprint.
PM: Ings. He drove Southampton’s escape from the drop. A push for the golden boot ultimately fell short but Ings scored all types of goals in all types of matches under all kinds of pressure. It’s likely Saints would have been sunk without him.
SM: Fernandes, who follows Billy Meredith, Denis Law and Eric Cantona in transforming Manchester United in a flash. He single-handedly saved Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s job, though whether that’s a good or bad thing for United in the long run is a debate for another day.
SN: Fernandes. Not cheap but transformative signings rarely are and that is what Fernandes has been for United. The midfielder has injected creativity and character into the team and with better players around him next season, namely in defence, could be the spearhead for a full-on United revival.
JS: Fernandes has given United hope.
LT: Saint-Maximin. Newcastle have not always been too easy on the eye this season – with one notable exception. The wonderfully skilful Saint-Maximin has brought a touch of Côte d’Azur sunshine to Tyneside, invariably proving gloriously entertaining with his chicane dribbles a consistent highlight. The excitement is only exacerbated by the winger’s sheer unpredictability. An unorthodox talent turned poster boy for the advantages of not coaching young boys too early, he played street football before joining the formal academy system later than most.
Worst flop
EA: João Cancelo was signed to give Manchester City more depth at full-back but has failed to live up to his £60m price tag. All the training in the park didn’t do Tanguy Ndombele much good either.
NA: Alex Iwobi has never quite shown top-bracket potential so it was some feat for Arsenal to persuade Everton to part with £35m for the winger last August. One league goal later, the deal seems even more staggering. For their part Arsenal can be charged with “biggest over-the-odds payment” in spending £72m on Nicolas Pépé, although the Ivorian has recently showed signs of settling in and at least provided some spectacular flourishes.
SB: It’s hard to judge between Ndombele’s £55m disappearing act at Tottenham and Arsenal’s entire league season, but either way this prize is heading to north London.
PD: Pep Guardiola. You don’t have to be Danny Drinkwater to know Premier League winners should have done much better. Manchester City lost their title in record time because they were defensively and mentally weak.
BF: The £34m Everton splashed out on Iwobi looked steep at the time but, almost a year on, it looks an extremely poor piece of business. Arsenal must have been pinching themselves.
BG: VAR. It was brought in to eliminate, or at least minimise, contentious decisions and has succeeded only in creating more. Time to put it back in its box and hide it under the bed.

AH: VAR. An unmitigated disaster that has stripped authority from referees and the pure joy of celebrating a goal from those who pay good money to be inside a stadium.
DH: I’m sorry to say that David Luiz has come to seem like a liability when he is one-on-one with attacking players. He doesn’t just make mistakes, he has catastrophes.
JJ: City’s title defence. Claiming three in a row is a mammoth ask. But going from champions to an 18-point deficit is odd.
JL: Arnaut Danjuma. There were more expensive flops, more spectacular flops, more inept flops. But as Bournemouth drop out of the league, somehow the £14m Dutch winger is emblematic of a club and a transfer strategy that badly lost its way. Only six starts, no goals and no assists in a miserable injury-plagued campaign.
PM: Ndombele. No doubt a technically proficient player with an eye for goal, his progress was hampered by a change of management. But Ndombele has failed to grasp the nettle of playing in the Premier League under José Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino and that’s not something that can be entirely blamed on others. A £55m club-record fee currently looks far from being justified.
SM: Brendan Rodgers. Finishing fifth with Leicester hardly counts as failure, except in the context of all that preening over release clauses amid vague interest from Arsenal. After securing a five-year big-bucks extension, his team were immediately schooled by Manchester City and Liverpool, triggering a dismal decline in confidence and form. If Leicester fail to start 2020-21 on the front foot, Leicester could be double-checking the fine print on that contract fairly quickly.
SN: VAR. There have been the clangers resulting from incompetence and officials being scared to overrule their mates and there have been the calls that have been technically correct but undeniably awful in how they have changed the flow and feeling of games. I was open to the introduction of VAR but, like many, would bin it after this most miserable of debut seasons.
JS: Roberto gave West Ham’s opponents hope. One of the worst goalkeepers to play in the Premier League. What on earth was Manuel Pellegrini thinking when he signed him? The deal cost him his job.
LT: Joelinton. It seems a bit cruel to single out Newcastle’s Brazilian, particularly as he seems nice, clearly tries his utmost and evidently cares. He’s also being played out of position at centre-forward – he shone in a left-sided attacking role at Hoffenheim. But, and it’s a big but, two Premier League goals when you cost £40m is simply not good enough.
Biggest gripe
EA: VAR and referees with personalised boots. But seriously: more common sense is needed next season please – Sheffield United’s goal against Aston Villa could easily have been given once the mistake over the ball crossing the line had been identified.
NA: Why was VAR railroaded upon us when officials were clearly not up to speed on its use? It has facilitated some important decisions but overall its impact on the division has been toxic. When it is combined with an absurd handball law, one would be forgiven for fearing outcomes are being dictated by people who actively dislike the sport. If the process can be improved – VAR worked seamlessly at the World Cup until the final, for example – then fantastic. But why inflict havoc on the world’s most popular league in the meantime?
SB: VARs taking 20 minutes to disallow goals because someone had an offside earlobe.
PD: One of Frank Lampard’s probably.

BF: The ingrained relationship between gambling and football. Half of the league’s teams wore shirts sponsored by betting firms.
BG: The woeful shortcomings of the handball law are a source of constant frustration and irritation.
AH: Footballers being singled out over pay cuts by the health secretary Matt Hancock while some of them took on what should be the government’s responsibility of funding the NHS and ensuring kids receive free school meals.
DH: I cannot stand it when goals are ruled out after lengthy VAR reviews for hairline offside decisions the naked eye cannot see.
JJ: Griping. It is football, it is a glorious pageant. Unadulterated entertainment. Enjoy.
JL: When people feel sufficiently secure in their racism to blazon it from a plane, as Burnley fans did in June, we can safely say that football’s culture has been too permissive of deplorable views. For all the laudable gestures football has made in recent months, there are not enough signs that the game’s authorities – governing bodies, clubs, platforms and the traditional media – are prepared to do the real hard work. That means educating fans, diversifying their own organisations and more actively policing the toxic tribal discourse masquerading as “debate”.
PM: That global pandemic which nearly crippled the sport then forced it to return without spectators as a new and sanitised phenomenon. Certainly puts VAR into perspective.
SN: Football’s return in June brought with it a host of innovations, among them the allowance of five substitutes. The reasoning behind it was sound but the effect was what many feared – an advantage for the bigger, richer clubs. So that should be the end of it, but, alas, no because the Premier League has been given permission to continue with it next season. It is a grim prospect and the hope must be that top-flight clubs say thanks but no thanks.
SM: Checking ... checking ... [completely unnecessary 120-second pause] ... ah yes, it’s VAR, which has completely banjaxed the natural rhythms of the game for no visible benefit. Pop it back in the box, will you? It’s fine to admit a mistake, we know you meant well.
JS: The law stating any goal featuring the use of an arm must be disallowed is infuriating. Nobody wants to see players punching the ball into the net but surely a middle ground can be found, especially now VAR is picking up the most minimal of accidental handballs. How is it fair to give a free-kick against a player who only handled the ball after being fouled by a defender first? Or against a player who has the ball kicked at his hand by an opponent?
LT: That Newcastle’s interminable Saudi takeover saga has been running for more than four months. The time for Richard Masters, the Premier League chief executive, to make a decision is long overdue. Masters is being desperately unfair on Newcastle, their fans and everyone connected with the club; if he wants to be a proper leader he needs to have the nerve to make contentious calls within acceptable timeframes. Meanwhile, Newcastle are left in paralysing limbo.

Premier League 2019-20 season review: our writers’ best and worst

Will the fact masks are now obligatory in shops in England finally – please God – mark the end of the mask culture wars? Will this spark a political and public commitment to sane and effective public health policies? Well, yes and no. On the one hand, it’s a relief that the government has finally listened to what the World Health Organization has been saying in increasingly desperate tones since early spring. On the other, complementary goggles seem to be required to make your way through this murky mire of regulation, social codes and libertarian posturing.
People in England are now required to wear masks when collecting food from cafes and takeaways. Other countries haven’t needed to legislate, perhaps because they had higher levels of trust in their governments. We are also being encouraged to “eat out to help out” (it’s fitting that the Tories, never a party famed for their generosity, didn’t seem to grasp the sexual connotations of this slogan), but no restaurant or pub staff appear to be wearing masks, because they “don’t have to”. Supermarkets are saying that they won’t be enforcing the law. Workers are being encouraged back into offices – remember them? – but without any clear mask-wearing policy, even though anyone who has tried to do a spreadsheet to the dulcet tones of a colleague’s hacking cough knows that offices are hotbeds of disease. All of these places are indoors, but only some are regulated. By legislating for some, you imply it’s OK to go without in others.




 

I have always been a catastrophist, but I never envisaged my future Ballardian nightmare involving the marketing of luxury silk plague masks on Instagram


I popped down to my local when it opened and had a glance inside, but it was a mask-free zone, so I didn’t go in. It’s such a simple thing, putting on a mask. It says: “I care about your welfare, as well as my own, and do not want to infect you.” It is, ultimately, an act of kindness and generosity, underpinned – and I have to keep stressing this – by science. Developed by scientists, to whom we used to defer, back when we lived in the old, lucid world.
The first time, I didn’t put my mask on properly. Like a member of the population of any country that doesn’t have an established culture of mask-wearing, my experience with face coverings was limited. I have never taken part in an Eyes Wide Shut-esque orgy, or been a black bloc anarchist, or held up a bank. No one has ever invited me to a masquerade ball or asked me to perform abdominal surgery, and I don’t own a house so have never sanded any floorboards. And yet, after that initial fumble, I somehow managed. It’s incredible what people can achieve, when they put their minds to it.
Wearing a mask is easy, but it does require new forms of social etiquette. I have found myself becoming very expressive with my eyes, as though everyone with whom I now converse is a newborn baby, or a kitten. After wasting my teenage years bingeing on America’s Next Top Model, I finally have the opportunity to show off my “smize”. Time spent living in Italy has increased my repertoire of hand gestures, though I haven’t quite been brave enough to imitate a pal from Calabria’s favoured move, which was to mime rubbing his crotch while rolling his eyes at the merest irritation. It is no longer easy to make bitchy asides to one’s friends, and so passive aggressiveness has taken a big hit. So have impromptu conversations with strangers on trains, finally bringing the north into line with the miserable south.
There’s a certain kind of person who refuses to wear a mask, and I hate to say it, but they are usually male (I’m joking, I’m an angry feminist, I love to say it). Don’t blame me, blame this study, which found that men were less inclined to wear them due to their being “shameful, not cool and a sign of weakness”, which is strange, because from the looks of these mask-denying types being cool never seemed to preoccupy them much before. Wearing a mask as a “chin guard” isn’t quite the sexy rebel-without-a-cause vibe you think it is, either. Weirdly, being a total baby isn’t all that alluring.

The writer Andrew Male perhaps said it best when he wrote: “Men complaining about masks because they ‘feel unnatural/uncomfortable’, ‘ruin the experience’ (of social interaction) ‘probably don’t work anyway’ and ‘have taken the fun out of it’ (going to the shops). Just seems strangely familiar is all.” Doesn’t it just? Maybe what we really need is another Johnny Condom song, though the lyrics to this 90s awareness campaign ring true: “I protect you from the viruses, so why not try me on?” The skewed logic of those wearing masks in supermarkets but not in pubs is also familiar to those of us who believed the playground rumour that you couldn’t get pregnant standing up.
And then there is fashion. I love fashion, but like any true acolyte, I also recognise that fashion is utterly ridiculous. Do I want this $45 Dolce & Gabbana face mask? Yes I do, more than I can fully articulate (and not as much as I want this one that has The Scream by Edvard Munch – himself no stranger to feelings of paralysing terror, or respiratory diseases). But I am also disturbed by the way that late-stage capitalism has so fully embraced pandemic chic. I have always been a catastrophist, but I never envisaged my future Ballardian nightmare involving the marketing of luxury silk plague masks on Instagram. Even my anxious little prepper amygdala failed to make that jump.
There’s something strangely dislocating about the Daily Mail’s sidebar of shame at the moment – it was never a landing pad for the well-adjusted, but now it’s reached the next level of barmy. “Leonardo DiCaprio, 45, is joined by glamorous girlfriend Camila Morrone, 23, as the couple enjoy a romantic al fresco dinner in LA” we are informed. The particulars of Morrone’s outfit are then described in great detail, with the exception of the matching mask that she is wearing in all the paparazzi photos. The pandemic, incidentally, provides women my age with an excellent opportunity to attempt to convince DiCaprio that we are under his apparent dating age threshold of 25, though we may require sunglasses as well as a mask. And probably a hat, as well.
It’s a brave new world, this 2020 planet, and wearing a mask (sorry, “muzzle”) is really the least you can do for your fellow human beings. I’m a latent hippy and so would say that, of course – my mask is from Etsy and made from paisley fabric. But that doesn’t mean that the whole thing isn’t stressful, and sad, and above all deeply, deeply weird. Perhaps that’s why photographs of Ben Affleck smoking a cigarette under his own mask resonated with me so much. It’s a mood.

Wearing a mask is easy – and I finally have the chance to show off my smize

"
It is 8.45am in Los Angeles and Ramy Youssef is at his freshest on what will be a long day full of press interviews. “This is just one of those days of like 30 questions in a row of ‘How is real-life Ramy different from TV Ramy?’” he laughs.
Nuanced, funny and humanising, Youssef’s eponymous TV show, Ramy, gets under the skin of his internal struggles as a young, second-generation Egyptian American, as he navigates what it means to be a good person and a good Muslim. It calls to mind series such as Dave, I May Destroy You or Fleabag – shows based on flawed but likable protagonists, addressing questions of morality for a millennial audience with humour and darkness. As it’s currently tricky to stream in the UK (it is available on Amazon’s StarzPlay channel here), you may not have heard of it. But, with a Golden Globe win earlier this year and season two guest-starring Oscar winner Mahershala Ali, momentum is building round both the man and the show.

Like TV Ramy, real-life Ramy grew up in New Jersey, visiting his grandparents in New York on weekends and spending his summers in Cairo. Real Ramy was into comedy and film-making as a hobby, but it was Laith Nakli (who plays Uncle Naseem in Ramy) who convinced him to seriously pursue acting when they met at a comedy festival more than 10 years ago. At 20, Youssef landed a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom and moved to LA, where he managed to sell Ramy before he even had a standup special out. Beyond that, I am reluctant to ask how much further the similarities go – especially considering that some of the storylines are a bit spicy (episode one has a toe-curling scene where a girl wants Ramy to choke her during sex).
The focus of the series is not just Ramy himself. Some of the most groundbreaking episodes are when the lens moves away from him and focuses on the other members of his family. Each is viewed with affection, but none are without their own, sometimes infuriating flaws. Ramy’s father defines himself by his work and struggles when he loses his job, while his chauvinistic brother-in-law, Ramy’s uncle Naseem, is a successful businessman. Best of all is his neurotic mother (Succession’s Hiam Abbass) whose unsolicited advice and objectionable opinions are reminiscent of a classic Arab auntie. What is striking is how her character appears in the episodes away from her children, where she is revealed as more than just a mother: complex and conflicted like Ramy himself, with her own sexual desires and frustrations. “I want to look at the way that we stereotype ourselves,” Youssef says.
Many of the themes raised in the show are universal, from the differences between generations to what it means to be a man. “How has Ramy been influenced by the way he’s been treated versus the way his sister’s been treated by their mother and father?” asks Youssef. “It’s like he has been babied so much because he’s a boy that it’s prevented him from becoming a man, or even just a version of his potential.”

In an age when tribalism groups people according to politics, race and experience, it is refreshing to see such seemingly contradictory yet relatable characters existing even within a nuclear family. The struggle isn’t just about “us” and “them”. As a practising Muslim, Ramy doesn’t simply have to contend with an Islamophobic society; some of his biggest issues are coming to terms with himself and his relationship with his own faith.
“I think for every character, very much so for the Ramy character, it’s ‘me versus me’,” he explains. “Whether it be with writers who are in our room or whether it be with people who are in my life, I try to imagine: what are they hiding?”

This approach has resulted in a show so honest that it can make for uncomfortable viewing. In series two, Ramy is getting to know a Muslim woman, and tries to be honest with her about his sexual history and the fact he thinks he has been watching too much porn. She advises him to “hide his sins”, a cultural and religious value that is shared across different Muslim communities.
So how does he square that principle with making a show that lays bare the transgressions of his characters? “If anything, because this show is fiction, this is a place to explore sin,” he says. “It allows there to be a reference point to talk about things, while others can continue to hide their sin.” For Youssef, this is the role of art in the community. “What should the artist be doing exactly? Showing Islam and its perfection? No, that’s what the teachers, imams and the sheikhs are supposed to be doing. I’m not studied on Islam, so my job, if anything, is to show a nuanced story in which we can discuss things. It doesn’t feel like a contradiction at all. If anything it feels like the purpose of the show.”
Youssef has been surprised at the show’s positive reception in the Middle East. “They get that we’re skipping all the entry-level conversations and trying to get into nuances about faith and ego. There’s this desire where American audiences sometimes are like: ‘Couldn’t you just have had some wholesome conversations as opposed to getting into all the ego, sex and drugs – all this stuff you went right into that makes people feel uncomfortable?’”

  Moonlighting ... Mahershala Ali and Ramy Youssef. Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/Hulu


Mahershala Ali’s appearance in season two, playing a wise and loving sheikh, has drawn more attention to the show. It’s clear that for Youssef this partnership was just as important on a personal level. “To me, it seems like a divine collaboration,” he says excitedly. Ali first reached out to thank Ramy for making series one. “It turned into me angling for us to meet and hang and eat,” he continues. Soon Ali was on set, praying with Ramy between scenes. “You never see a religious leader on TV that isn’t chockful of hypocrisies or corruption, and we get to have this guy who is full of love,” he says. “It’s so hard to even imagine someone else playing that role.”
Even off screen, Youssef has led with his faith. When he received his Golden Globe earlier this year for lead actor in a comedy series, he thanked God in his acceptance speech, saying “Allahu Akbar”, a phrase that in the western world is often associated with acts of terrorism, but for Muslims simply means “God is great”. He was asked in the press room later if he did so for the benefit of host Ricky Gervais – a staunch atheist – whose monologue roasting Hollywood’s hypocrisies and performative politics went viral.
“The timing of it was funny after what Ricky said, but it was really important,” Youssef says, adding that Gervais is “a really funny and a really cool dude”. He even reached out to Gervais about how the line between atheists and believers has come full circle. “I told Ricky that he talked about God so much, he might be Muslim!” he laughs.
As trust in the media and lawmakers declines, much comedy has become more political. What does Youssef make of people turning to comedians such as Trevor Noah and Hasan Minhaj for their news? “To me that’s a genre of comedy,” he says carefully. “The truth I think comedy should be providing is emotional truth.
“Emotional truths are hard to put into words,” he adds. “But you can put them into a joke. And that’s what the joke is about … I love that I can be wrong on a factual level, wrong on a political level. [But] I love that I can be right on an emotional level.” And whether it’s as real-life Ramy or as TV Ramy, that’s the thing that matters most.
Ramy season two is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video’s StarzPlay from 6 August

Ramy Youssef: ‘Ricky Gervais talks about God so much, he might be Muslim!’

When James Hamblin tells people he has not used soap in the shower for five years, they tend not to hold back in expressing their disgust. “It’s one of the few remaining things for which we feel fine telling someone that they’re gross,” he says. “It’s amazing to me, honestly.”
Yet despite people’s “clearly moralising judgments”, Hamblin is no hygiene slouch. Even pre-pandemic, he made a point of washing his hands with soap. He is, after all, a doctor who lectures at the Yale School of Public Health and a medical writer and podcaster for the US magazine the Atlantic. At 37, he looks so youthful that he still gets compared to the fictional child doctor Doogie Howser.
But eschewing soap on your pits and bits does raise awkward technical questions, more on which after some context. Hamblin’s minimalist showering habits evolved gradually, after he relocated from California to a studio apartment in Brooklyn, New York, to pursue a writing career. He needed to save time, money and space. Simultaneously, he says: “I started learning about emerging microbiome science and decided to try going all-out for a bit.”
Even if you have not yet read up on our microbiomes – the trillions of microbes that lead symbiotic lives with humans, colonising our skin and our guts – you may have spotted vague statements such as “microbiome-gentle” printed on bottles of shower gel. This because microbiologists – and brands – are learning more and more about the complex relationship we have with our germs. These include their starring roles in developing our immune systems, protecting us from pathogens (by creating antimicrobial substances and competing with them for space and resources) and lessening the likelihood of autoimmune conditions such as eczema. So, there is a growing awareness that scrubbing them off, along with the natural oils on which they feed, or dousing them with antibacterial products may not be the best idea after all.

Hamblin’s new regime got him thinking about modern notions of cleanliness, what is natural and how these two issues are, frankly, all over the shop. Stigmatism of body odour began as an advertising strategy that helped quadruple the sales of Lifebuoy soap in the 20s. A century later, we still live in fear of anyone detecting the slightest hint of BO on us. We are more perfumed, moisturised and exfoliated than ever.
Yet despite advances in skincare and modern medicine, conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis, as well as other autoimmune diseases, have been rising steadily. Also, while we attempt to appear squeaky clean, research has revealed that many of us don’t wash our hands properly – or at all – when it matters most: before eating and after going to the toilet. (That said, awareness of the importance of handwashing has certainly risen as a result of Covid-19.)
“It’s all mixed up right now, right?” says Hamblin, who set out to explore these paradoxes in perceived cleanliness in his book Clean: The New Science of Skin and the Beauty of Doing Less. He says the key to the success of his experiments, which saw him all but give up deodorant, was his “slow-fade” approach. “As I gradually used less and less, I started to need less and less,” he writes. “My skin slowly became less oily, and I got fewer patches of eczema. I didn’t smell like pine trees or lavender, but I also didn’t smell like the oniony body odour that I used to get when my armpits, used to being plastered with deodorant, suddenly went a day without it.” As his girlfriend put it, he smelled “like a person”.
It is not that we were unaware of bodily odours before “BO” was coined, but Hamblin thinks our natural smells are far more nuanced and informative than we give them credit for. “We know from historical writings that certainly people smelled bad. We didn’t just accept all smells,” he says. “Now, if someone smells sweaty or of anything less than soap, perfume or cologne, we think of that as being unclean.”

Hamblin started to notice that he smelled less pleasant when stressed. He interviewed a researcher who could train dogs to sniff out cancer in humans, while lovers he spoke to told him they thought the way their partner smelled naturally was good. He writes: “The hundreds of subtle volatile chemical signals we emit may play roles in communicating with other people (and other species) in ways we’re just beginning to understand.”
Hamblin also highlights the bare-faced cheek behind the rise of the skincare industry, as soap progressed from a multipurpose, often homemade product to a seemingly infinite parade of near-identical concoctions advertised for different problems, genders and occasions, at wildly different prices. Once hooked on daily soapings that remove our natural oils, we needed moisturisers and hair conditioners to replace them. In the 50s, the industry further cashed in by highlighting the drying effects of soap and offering milder detergents. Today, Hamblin writes, we have come full circle; many people seek products that are “as close as possible to nothing at all”.
He writes about a fellow journalist – and soap dodger – Maya Dusenbery, who had been prescribed every acne treatment going. The only one that worked? Nothing at all.
She had tried astringents, to dry out the skin; oral and topical antibiotics; the pill; and isotretinoin, a drug that has been linked to side-effects such as suicidal thoughts and inflammatory bowel disease. Not only were these ineffective, but she also developed rheumatoid arthritis – an agonising autoimmune condition. When she started taking immune-suppressing medication for that, her hair started falling out. 
Enough was enough: Dusenbery stopped taking any medication for her skin. After an extremely oily few months, it settled. Now, the only things that touch her face are a microfibre cloth and water. Thanks to her adoption of a more holistic approach to her rheumatoid arthritis, in consultation with a specialist, this has gone into remission, too.
On the subject of antibiotics, Hamblin writes that they have commonly been prescribed for acne; he says they “seem to play a part in causing and exacerbating autoimmune disease” and that “antibiotic overuse is likely to be a bigger threat to biomes than hygiene”.

Perhaps as a result of experiences such as Dusenbery’s, microbiologists, dermatologists and skincare companies are striving to create new medicines for skin conditions, along with mainstream beauty products that contain live bacteria or ingredients that could feed our microbiomes. There is even the prospect of bespoke products from beauty behemoths such as L’Oréal that are tailored to our own skin microbiomes, which are as unique as our fingerprints. But we are certainly not there yet – and we should be wary, says Hamblin, of “anyone who’s out there right now selling a single microbe, or who tells you that you have a certain [microbial] imbalance you need to get corrected medically”.
There is a good chance we will never understand our microbiomes well enough to manipulate them confidently and to positive effect. “Maybe there are some things we can do, but … it keeps coming back to this holistic sense of ‘everything matters’.”
Microbiologists have found that hunter-gatherers and Amish people, who work together on farms from childhood, have optimally diverse microbiomes and minimal chances of contracting autoimmune conditions and associated inflammation. Urban westerners who want to boost their more modest skin microbes would benefit from close contact with other people and animals, and from spending as much time as possible in nature, preferably getting dirty.
But now that we are in a pandemic, much of that behaviour is on hold. In fact, if the relative sterility of the world before Covid-19 (in which Hamblin’s book was written) was already compromising our microbial balance, lockdowns and social distancing could challenge it even more. “I don’t know when we’ll go back to handshaking and ways that we might have been sharing different sorts of microbes with one another,” says Hamblin.
Of course, reducing antibiotic use is key to microbiome success, along with resisting washing so frequently. Which brings us to bottoms – for this is what people visualise when they get grossed out over other people not soaping themselves. How can you get rid of unwanted residue down there with just your hand and water? “Dry toilet paper kind of creates that problem,” says Hamblin. “If you were gardening and had mud all over your hands, would you just use a dry paper towel? No, you’d at least get them wet and scrub them together. When people use bidets, they have less of an issue with that, or when people use disposable towelette things.” But the towelettes are expensive, wasteful and block drains, he admits, so “wetting toilet paper is fine”. This is his solution, which he shares to satisfy curiosity, rather than to preach or prescribe. And no, the paper does not fall apart when wet – “unless you’re trying to drown it”.

Soap dodger: meet the doctor who says we have been showering wrong
",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/28/soap-dodger-meet-the-doctor-who-says-we-have-been-showering-wrong
"
It was a balmy June day in 2017 when Donald Trump took to the lectern in the White House Rose Garden to announce the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, the only comprehensive global pact to tackle the spiraling crisis.
Todd Stern, who was the US’s chief negotiator when the deal was sealed in Paris in 2015, forced himself to watch the speech.
“I found it sickening, it was mendacious from start to finish,” said Stern. “I was furious … because here we have this really important thing and here’s this joker who doesn’t understand anything he’s talking about. It was a fraud.”

195 countries

The terms of the accord mean no country can leave before November this year, so due to a quirk of timing, the US will officially exit the Paris deal on 4 November – 100 days from now and just one day after the 2020 presidential election.
The completion of Stern’s misery, and possibly any realistic hopes of averting disastrous climate change, rests heavily upon the outcome of the election, which will pit Trump against former vice-president Joe Biden, who has vowed to rejoin the climate agreement.

The lifetime of the Paris agreement, signed in a wave of optimism in 2015, has seen the five hottest years ever recorded on Earth, unprecedented wildfires torching towns from California to Australia, record heatwaves baking Europe and India and temperatures briefly bursting beyond 100F (38C) in the Arctic.
These sorts of impacts could be a mere appetizer, scientists warn, given they have been fueled by levels of global heating that are on track to triple, or worse, by the end of the century without drastic remedial action. The faltering global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and head off further calamity hinges, in significant part, on whether the US decides to re-enter the fray.
“The choice of Biden or Trump in the White House is huge, not just for the US but for the world generally to deal with climate change,” said Stern. “If Biden wins, November 4 is a blip, like a bad dream is over. If Trump wins, he seals the deal. The US becomes a non-player and the goals of Paris become very, very difficult. Without the US in the long term, they certainly aren’t realistic.”

Nearly 200 countries put their name to the Paris accords, pledging to face down the climate emergency and limit the average global temperature rise to “well below” 2C above the era before mass industrialization started pumping huge volumes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere from cars, trucks, power plants and farms. A more aspirational goal of halting temperatures at a 1.5C rise was also included although, just five years on, the planet is already creeping perilously close to this mark.
The Paris deal brought major, growing emitters like China and India on board with the quest to shift towards cleaner sources of energy, in part due to the urgings of Barack Obama, who claimed the agreement showed the US was now a “global leader in the fight against climate change”.

Trump, who once famously called climate science a “hoax”, has never looked kindly on the deal, which he framed as an international effort to damage the US while letting China off too lightly. In his Rose Garden speech, Trump remarked that he was elected to “represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” In reality, each country is free to choose its own emissions cuts without any sort of enforcement. “Paris is like a vessel, such as a glass – you can pour water or wine into it,” said Sue Biniaz, a former US state department lawyer who drafted parts of the Paris deal. “It’s not the design of Paris that’s the problem, it’s that there’s not the political will to do enough.”

  Why Trump abandoning the climate fight puts the planet in even more danger – video explainer


Abandoned climate efforts
The US government in practice abandoned any concern over the climate crisis some time ago, with the Trump administration so far rolling back more than 100 environmental protections, including an Obama-era plan to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants, limits on pollution emitted from cars and trucks and even energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs. In an often chaotic presidency, Trump’s position on climate change has been unusually consistent – American fossil fuel production must be bolstered, restrictive climate regulations must be scrapped.
Unswayed by growing alarm among Americans over the climate crisis, Trump is taking this same message to the election. “Biden wants to massively re-regulate the energy economy, rejoin the Paris climate accord, which would kill our energy totally, you would have to close 25% of your businesses and kill oil and gas development,” the president said this month, without citing evidence, as he announced another rollback, this time of environmental assessments of pipelines, highways and other infrastructure.

Despite all this, US emissions have continued to fall, due in large part to the downfall of a coal industry that Trump has attempted to prop up. The international ramifications have been telling, however – in the absence of any sort of positive cajoling from the US, global emissions have remained stubbornly high and most countries are lagging behind their own promised actions.
According to the Climate Action Tracker, only Morocco is acting consistently with the Paris agreement’s goals, with the global temperature rise set to exceed 3C by the end of the century even if the current pledges are met. Paris was meant to be only the beginning – countries are supposed to continually ratchet up their ambition levels until the more extreme ravages of climate change, such as dire flooding, heatwaves, crop failures and the loss of coral reefs, are avoided.

“There’s been less political will from other countries to take action to a certain extent because the US isn’t pushing for it,” said Biniaz. “During the first four years of Trump it’s easier to say it’s likely to be an aberration, a short-term deviation, but if it’s eight years it’s harder to keep together the coalition of countries that care about this.”
‘Another meteorite is coming’
Another four years of a Trump administration uninterested in the climate crisis could set back global emissions cuts by a decade, according to one published analysis, making the chances of meeting the goals of Paris near to impossible.
Hakon Saelen, an environmental economist at the University of Oslo who led the study, said the US withdrawal is a “significant major blow” to the mitigation of the climate crisis. “The world cannot afford any delay if the 2C target is to be reached,” he said. “Our model indicates that the chance of reaching it is very low already, but near zero with another Trump term.”

But even with an engaged Biden administration that is somehow able to get Congress to agree to a $2tn plan to shift the US on to renewable energy, the challenge is immense. The world has dithered on cutting emissions for so long that only an unprecedented, rapid overhaul of the way we travel, generate energy and eat will keep humanity within the bounds of safety outlined in Paris.
The world will have to slash emissions by more than 7% a year this decade to have any hope of meeting the 1.5C target, according to the United Nations. This annual cut will be achievable this year only through the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered much of the global economy. A more sustainable path to decarbonization will need to be immediately identified and implemented.
“The warmer it gets the worse it gets and the [Paris] targets are broadly at a level where things will get really bad,” said Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute. “We don’t want people to give up hope, the human race won’t become extinct at 2C but that’s an unnecessarily high bar. There are still large threats and a lot of good reasons to keep warming below that.
Stern said American voters will naturally be “supersonic focused” on coronavirus and the economic fallout. “But climate change can’t be forgotten this election,” he said. “The Covid crisis has shown us countries can do remarkable things in short order when they believe they have to. It shows us we need leaders who also understand what we need to do on climate change, because that is another meteorite heading our way.”

How the global climate fight could be lost if Trump is re-elected
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/27/global-climate-fight-could-be-lost-trump-re-elected
"
Jeans are out; dressing gowns in. These are not the trends anyone would have predicted for the summer of 2020, but then so little has gone according to plan this year. Bras, especially the underwired variety, were among the first items of clothing to be given the heave-ho under lockdown. But they have not been the only fashion casualty – shoes and coats quickly became redundant under the government’s “stay at home” advice. For some, fashion habits have shifted over time – apparently, there are only so many work Zoom calls you can attend in your pyjamas before the novelty wears off. And now, with measures easing, it is becoming clear how our pandemic-inflected sense of style may translate into life in the “new normal”. Here’s how Guardian readers say lockdown has changed the way they dress – perhaps for good.
Goodbye, tailoring
Those who have changed the way they dress most dramatically during lockdown are surely the work-from-home employees (and furloughed staff) who were previously required to adhere to corporate dress codes. Few employers seem to have insisted on this for remote working; a sharp suit or expensive tailoring sits uneasily alongside unwashed dishes and jammy-handed toddlers, after all. Better to just acknowledge that every day is casual Friday.
“I work in financial services, and I am usually based in Canary Wharf,” says Amber. “This means a lot of tailoring: shift dresses, blazers, shirts etc. All of that has gone into storage and I am doing the same job in a pair of trackie bottoms and a vest (or sleeved top for video calls). It is super-comfy and I’m saving a lot on dry cleaning. I’ve also not had to iron anything in months.”

But, with Boris Johnson pushing for a return to the office in August, is it time to dust off your trouser press? Not necessarily, says Amber. “Lockdown has given me time to think about what I really like wearing, and I’m actually quite excited about starting to shift my wardrobe in that direction.”
She is not the only one who sees the changes inspired by lockdown having a long-term effect. “I’m being sent images of collections for spring/summer 2021, and I’m not convinced that fashion designers have made the pivot that may be needed,” says 49-year-old Nicola Hibon Jackson, who owns two independent lifestyle boutiques in London. “So many clothes are designed for a semi-formal office environment – the tailored jacket, tapered trousers etc – and I’m not convinced that this is what women will be wanting next year.”
The end of jeans?
The demise of denim, specifically jeans, may have initially gone unnoticed. “I put on some skinny jeans a week ago and took them straight off again. Did they always feel so restrictive?” says Amber. After months spent wearing leggings, joggers and long, loose dresses, it is easy to see why tight-fitting clothes in rigid materials may have lost their appeal.
Liz Jones, a 44-year-old editor, has swapped her jeans for her partner’s: “A couple of years ago, I lost a lot of weight. During lockdown, I returned to my more regular weight,” she says. “So I’ve been wearing my partner’s old jeans, which are flattering and more comfortable. I may never need to buy jeans again.”
Similarly, Niamh Egleston, a 25-year-old student, sees jeans as “a relic of the before times” having switched to long, floaty skirts during lockdown. “The thought of vacuum-packing my stomach into a pair of high-waisted skinny jeans makes me ill,” she says.
The fact that jeans were once a wardrobe staple now seems unfathomable to many. In fact, sales of jeans had already been on the wane, partly thanks to the numerous eco-controversies associated with their production. Could Covid consign them to the fashion archive? Not if Diesel has anything to do with it. The denim brand claims its antiviral jeans kill 99% of Covid germs within two hours – although not all experts are convinced.

The new rules of beauty
It is not just our clothes that have been given a lockdown overhaul – many of us have used the time away from social engagements to make changes to our hair and makeup routines. “Just before lockdown, my two eldest grandchildren suggested I let my hair go grey – good advice, as it turned out,” says one retired teacher, Julie. “My stylist lightened my hair to blend with my roots a few days before she closed, so it was good timing.”
With hairdressers having been shut until recently, Jones has also been making changes to her look. “I’ve been wearing headscarves to cover my hair as it grows out,” she says. “I’m in no hurry to have a proper haircut, although we trimmed the back, and may persist with the scarves even when my hair is longer.”
For many women, who are still charged considerably more than men in some salons, not being able to book appointments has been a blessing and a curse. “I’ve really enjoyed not spending ridiculous amounts on haircuts and salon hair colour,” says 42-year-old Lucy Matthews. “I have only really missed not getting my eyebrows shaped … neat eyebrows seem even more important with face masks now!”
For some, putting on the makeup they would usually wear has been key to maintaining a feeling of normality, while others have relished the opportunity to go bare-faced. “I’m loving being so comfortable and skipping makeup – I’ve only worn it three times since mid-March,” says Heena, a 35-year-old NHS worker. “I feel I’ve broken the tyrannical shackles of the patriarchy, and some changes are permanent. I’m done with waxing or otherwise grooming my eyebrows. I was born with a perfect pair, and the world has to accept them.”
Staying in is the new going out 
Contrary to reports that loungewear reigned supreme during lockdown, plenty of people have been getting dressed up to stay home. “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed dressing up for Zoom meetings with friends and going all out on Saturday nights for our romantic dinner for two,” says Julie. “I’ve been self-isolating for 17 weeks and we’ve not eaten the same meal twice nor worn the same outfit twice on Saturday nights. Unbelievable, as I’m definitely the sort of person who looks in the wardrobe and thinks I’ve got nothing to wear!”
Josh Van Gelder, a 51-year-old photographer based in London, turned his penchant for clothes into a creative project. “I have a huge collection of vintage clothes, so thought it would be fun to see if I could wear a different outfit every day for the duration of the lockdown,” he says. “Clothes can be such an expression of how you’re feeling, so by making the effort to dress up, it automatically gave me a boost.”

So-called dopamine dressing – the idea that colourful clothes can help brighten dark days – has also proved popular during lockdown. “Spending more time in nature – one good thing that has come out of lockdown – has encouraged me to embrace colours,” says Charlotte, a 25-year-old arts administrator. 
Ivan Berazhny, a 42-year-old university lecturer, has had a similar experience: “Before lockdown, I preferred neutral, conservative clothing in the office and at home,” he says, but recently he has switched to wearing bolder, brighter colours, “more white, floral, and art-patterned clothes”. It’s a change he believes will continue beyond lockdown. “The new choices keep me happier, lift my mood, and inspire the mundane routines,” he says.
A shift in shopping
Long-term, perhaps the biggest change will not be to what we wear, but how we shop. Fashion is notoriously bad for the planet: the industry is responsible for 10% of total global carbon dioxide emissions every year. With bricks-and-mortar retail closed throughout much of lockdown, we have been forced into doing something many of us have long been committed to in theory, if not always in practice: avoiding fast fashion and “shopping” from our own wardrobes.
“Shopping for clothes used to be a treat,” says 53-year-old Anne, who works for a charity. “The area where I worked had loads of clothes shops and I used to go out to browse at lunchtime. Shopping is now a chore and I’d rather treat myself in other ways, such as spending more on food or wine. After not going out much for months, I have realised that there are items of clothing that I haven’t worn at all this year, which has made me think I don’t need so many.”
The musician and actor Annie Grace agrees: “I like wearing something ‘new’, even though it may be 10 years old or more, and I’ve enjoyed the comments from friends about the change of style. I don’t need to shop for clothes for the foreseeable future – I already have too many.” Similarly, Sabà Thabit, a 24-year-older blogger and translator from Tunisia, has learned to love her lockdown look. “I used to care so much if people thought I wasn’t putting enough effort into my looks,” she says, “but isolation made me reconnect with myself and I’m feeling more comfortable inside and out.”

Trend forecaster Li Edelkoort called this change in spending habits a “quarantine on consumption”, predicting that we would “learn how to be happy just with a simple dress, rediscovering old favourites we own” – an experience borne out by many over the past few months.
“I think the silver lining of lockdown has been that people have been forced to go through the clothing they already own,” says the London-based gin expert Nicolle Smith. “We’ve all discovered our ‘capsule wardrobe’. I realised I had enough clothes and that, with the exception of a few things like running shoes and underwear, I wouldn’t miss shopping or fashion if the big stores and the high street became a thing of the past.”
The pandemic has drawn attention to allegations over unfit working conditions – with claims that staff had their health put at risk by working through lockdown – at some factories in Leicester which, it was claimed, supply fast fashion brands such as Boohoo. Although most online outlets have continued to trade during the pandemic, these allegations may have also encouraged those who have continued to shop to think more carefully about where they take their custom. Boohoo has launched an investigation, and said it was not responsible for the issues at the supply factories.
“I’ve tried to experiment with my existing wardrobe, and have hardly bought anything new,” says student Rebecca Hitchon. It’s a change that she sees continuing as the lockdown begins to ease. “Even when the shops reopened, I didn’t enjoy it like I used to, as it seemed so stressful. I would rather spend more money buying better clothes every once in a while; items that will last and that will have less of a harmful impact on the environment and people.”
It is a sentiment shared by many, including Hil G, a graphic designer based in Ireland. “In the past, I have made hasty purchases – it’s very easy to just add items to a virtual cart and checkout without standing in a queue!” she says. “But now I’m more particular about what I purchase. It has strengthened my love for clothes that are well made and sustainably sourced. From now on, I’d like to buy clothes that I will want to keep for ever.”

'The thought of skinny jeans makes me ill!' Five ways 2020 has changed fashion

"
Peter McKenna remembers the trickle of visitors who started panning for gold in the Sperrin mountains of County Tyrone in the 1970s. “We put them in the same bracket as the leprechauns and the ringforts, end of the rainbow type stuff.”
It turned out there really was gold. But an attempt to start mining in the 1980s faltered – the Troubles were raging and authorities feared the IRA would steal any explosives brought into this corner of Northern Ireland.
Now, with the Troubles a memory, a New York-based investment fund is planning to build a mine at Greencastle, a hamlet in the Sperrin mountains that sits atop what is by grade one of the world’s biggest unexcavated gold deposits, worth an estimated £3bn.
McKenna, a gold sceptic no more, is a community relations manager for the mining company Dalradian Gold, and instead of leprechauns he envisages licences, drilling and jobs. “This is something that has world potential.”

Its fate hangs in the balance. The Stormont government announced on 29 June a public inquiry into the application, saying it had received more than 40,000 representations, the vast majority objections.
The proposed site at Greencastle is just one of a slew of applications to mine gold in the Dalradian supergroup, a 450-mile belt of rock spanning Ireland and Scotland.
A surge in global prices – hovering at $1,800 an ounce as investors seek a haven from turbulent markets – may further whet the appetite for Celtic gold on both sides of the North Channel.
Commercial extraction of ore at the UK’s only operational gold mine at Cononish near Tyndrum is to start later this year. Cononish is doing geological surveys at two other nearby sites and has exploration licences for 13 parts of the southern Highlands.
A second firm, Erris Resources, has begun test sampling at two sites south of Loch Tay in Perthshire that it says have “good prospects” for gold, silver and zinc. Those licences cover hundreds of square kilometres.
Other companies have obtained gold prospecting licences for several counties in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including a site in Clontibret, county Monaghan, said to hold about 500,000 ounces. It is 40 miles south of Greencastle.

The Dalradian supergroup was becoming famous for untapped gold, said Richard Gray, the managing director of Scotgold Resources, which owns Cononish. “In the parlance of geologists, it’s elephant country.”
The geological formation is named after the Dál Riata, a Gaelic kingdom credited with a golden age of influence in the sixth century. The prospect of mining companies ushering in a literal golden age has polarised opinion in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some welcome the promise of jobs and investment. Others, including conservationists and environmentalists, fear pollution and despoliation.

Politicians and regulators face intense lobbying from both sides. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) is drafting its first mining and quarrying strategy which will cover the water and environmental pollution laws gold mines need to uphold.
“We’re clear that environmental compliance is non-negotiable. Every Scottish business will comply with the law, and we’ll work to ensure as many as possible will go even further,” said Kenny Boag, Sepa’s head of strategic regulatory initiatives.
Northern Ireland’s infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, said a public inquiry would “robustly scrutinise” the proposed mine at Greencastle.
Battle lines have formed for the greatest prize in the Dalradian supergroup. On one side stands Orion Resource Partners, a US investment fund that owns Dalradian Resources, the Canadian parent company of Dalradian Gold.
After spending £130m exploring the site it submitted an application for a mine and processing plant in 2017, later revising the application when it dropped plans to use cyanide. The company posits hundreds of jobs, a £750m lift to Northern Ireland’s economy – and clean practices to protect a designated area of outstanding natural beauty.

“We’re a first world country with first world standards,” said McKenna. To extract an estimated 3.5m ounces of gold the mine would remove about 1,500 tonnes of rock per day and return about half of it, backfilling tunnels. “Compared internationally it’s a baby, engineers call it a boutique mine,” said McKenna.
On the other side stands a group of residents who doubt the promised jobs and fear contamination of air, land and water. They staff the Greencastle People’s Office, a clutch of caravans near the proposed mine which serves as a command centre.
“First they’ll blast with explosives and that’ll just be the start. It would wipe out this whole area, it would be toxic,” said John O’Donnell, who fishes trout in rivers.
Martin Tracey, 46, a farmer, said damaging dust particles could reach schools and homes close to the site. “If that lodges in the lungs it doesn’t come out again. How much is a human life worth? It’s like someone coming into your house and attacking your family.”
The protesters accuse Northern Ireland’s main political parties of ignoring them and question the independence of an inquiry that will sit before the planning appeals commission.
The proposed mine has divided the community and sundered friendships, with each side accusing the other of surveillance and intimidation.
Instead of gold, the mine may excavate a history of resistance to outsiders that dates back centuries, said Tracey. “We’re well prepared to fight these guys. The pedigree is there. I’m not going to lie down.”

'How much is a life worth?': Northern Irish community split over gold-mining plans
",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/28/how-much-is-a-life-worth-northern-irish-community-split-over-gold-mining-plans
"
In January 2011, James Tomsheck, then a top internal affairs investigator inside US Customs and Border Protection, attended a meeting of about 100 senior CBP leaders in a hotel in Irvington, Virginia.
Amid the sanitized splendor of the hotel ballroom, he vividly recalls hearing the nation’s then highest-ranking border patrol agent, David Aguilar, laying out his vision for the future. Border patrol, the former CBP deputy commissioner said, was to become the “marine corps of the US federal law enforcement community”.
Another leading CBP figure remarked that border agents were not required to adhere to the same constitutional restraints on the use of force as other law enforcers. “We are not cops,” he said.

Fast forward to this month, when Tomsheck absorbed with mounting foreboding the images of federal officers – led by border patrol agents – wielding teargas and flash bangs against protesters in Portland, Oregon.
As news circulated of demonstrators being shot in the face with “less lethal” munitions, and of unidentified masked agents in camouflage strong-arming civilians into unmarked vans, the nightmare scenario Tomsheck had heard expressed by his bosses almost a decade ago – of border patrol becoming a nationwide militarized force operating outside constitutional constraints – was becoming real.
“Border patrol has always seen itself as a militarized force, and that aspiration is now being enabled by the current administration,” Tomsheck told the Guardian.
On Thursday, Trump ramped up his threat to send border patrol agents into US cities to tackle what he claims is an epidemic of violence and anarchy sweeping urban areas. He told Fox News he was prepared to send in 75,000 federal officers, warning: “We’ll go into all of the cities, any of the cities. We’re ready.”

Trump has made what he depicts as crime-ridden inner cities under the control of incompetent Democratic mayors a running theme of his hyper-partisan presidency since its inception. He famously invoked “American carnage” in his 2017 inauguration speech.
By dispatching federal agents to Portland, and potentially rolling out the exercise to other cities such as Chicago, New York and Albuquerque, the US president has turned his dystopian oratory into political reality.
That he should have selected the US border patrol as the lead agency in his new reality-TV bid to seize control of civilian streets is especially alarming to those who are familiar with the agency’s track record. The most comprehensive tally of its fatal abuses, recorded by the Southern Border Community Coalition, has found at least 111 people have died as the result of an encounter with a border agent since 2010.
Tomsheck investigated numerous cases of what he concluded to be inappropriate use of lethal force resulting in needless death during his time at CBP internal affairs from 2006 to 2014. “Time and time again I saw incidents unfold where people – always Latinos, almost always Mexican citizens – lost their lives at the hands of border patrol agents.”
In the same period, the Bush administration drastically expanded the border patrol, almost doubling the number of agents to its current 20,000 and boosting its budget from $1.5bn in 2006 towards the $5bn it is today. The CBP now prides itself at being what it calls “one of the world’s largest law enforcement organizations”.

  Portland protests: why Trump has sent in federal agents – video report


While the size and scope of the agency has mushroomed, its accountability has lagged behind. Daniel Martinez, a sociologist at the University of Arizona, analyzed how abuse complaints are handled and found that the body acts with relative impunity.
His research led him to the conclusion there is “a culture of cruelty towards migrants and border crossers that dehumanizes and demeans border crossers. So to see border agents who have already been desensitized by the mistreatment of immigrants redirected to engaging with protesters in the interior is very concerning.”

More concerning still is that the federal officers deployed in Portland, ostensibly to protect federal property, were spearheaded by an elite unit, the border patrol tactical unit. Better known as Bortac, it is a quasi-militarised outfit equivalent to the Navy Seals.
Todd Miller, the author of Empire of Borders, has dubbed Bortac as “the robocops of US border patrol”.
Operating largely in secret, Bortac agents are trained for Swat-style raids on organized gangs smuggling immigrants or drugs across the US border. They have been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in many Latin American countries.
Their frontline role in Portland was controversial because they have no apparent training in crowd control or the policing of protests. It built upon the Trump administration’s decision in February to dispatch Bortac into the US interior to work alongside Ice immigration officers in apprehending undocumented immigrants in Democratically-controlled “sanctuary cities”.
Jenn Budd spent six years working as a senior border patrol agent until 2001 when she blew the whistle on a station chief who was himself smuggling drugs. She was offered promotion in exchange for her silence on the subject, but resigned in disgust.
In her years as an agent she got to know Bortac well. She remembers them as the “biggest guys, like the jocks in a football team. They live in tight groups like the Navy Seals, spending their time in military-style training.”
In Budd’s experience, Bortac agents are among “the most violent and racist in all law enforcement”.
The quasi-military nature of the unit goes beyond their training, percolating into their state of mind. “They don’t exist within the realm of civilian law enforcement,” Budd said. “They view people they encounter in the military sense as enemy combatants, meaning they have virtually no rights.”
That strain of extra-judicial aggression runs through everything Bortac does, Budd said. “They don’t do normal vehicle stops. They will rip drivers from their seat, throw him against the side, put him in handcuffs – the same tactics you are now seeing Bortac agents use in Portland.”
Under the rules of the border patrol they are allowed to operate within 100 miles of any US border, including those with Mexico and Canada as well as both coasts. As a result, their writ covers almost two-thirds of the population of the country – some 200 million people – and embraces nine of the nation’s 10 largest cities, many of which Trump is now targeting.
Inside the 100-mile zone, border patrol agents are to some degree free of constitutional restraints that apply to other law enforcers. “They can set up checkpoints up to 100 miles from the border, as they have at Gila Bend and Casa Grande in Arizona,” Tod Miller said. “They consciously operate as though they were above the fourth amendment prohibitions on unreasonable search and seizures, though civil rights groups fiercely contest that.”
Two other aspects of the culture of border patrol are relevant to the current furor over their mobilization in inner cities. Racism and Donald Trump.
Racism has plagued the institution for decades. Jenn Budd recalled that when she signed up for service in 1995 her Spanish instructor blithely informed her that Latino migrants were referenced within the agency as “tonks” and “wetbacks”.
“There’s a prevailing view that all migrants are criminals, and that if you stop someone in their vehicle who looks Latino and speaks Spanish, they are probably criminal too,” she said.
Last year ProPublica exposed a secret Facebook group for current and former border patrol agents whose posts were riddled with violent, racist and sexist language including jokes about migrant deaths. One of the posts exhorted agents to throw a “burrito at these bitches”, referring to Democratic congresswomen calling for an investigation of border facility abuses.
The Intercept went on to reveal that both the current chief of border patrol, Rodney Scott, and his predecessor Carla Provost, were among the group’s almost 9,500 members – almost half the entire force.
While the Facebook group was hidden from public view, there has been no attempt to obscure the passionate, almost obsessive, support that border patrol offers Trump. In March 2016 the then Republican presidential candidate received a boost to his bid for his party’s nomination when the union representing border patrol agents endorsed him.

Since then, the relationship has grown ever tighter. Border patrol has enthusiastically followed Trump’s executive orders, even when they mired the agency deep in controversy such as when its agents removed infants from their mothers’ arms under Trump’s 2018 policy of family separation.
The National Border Patrol Council, the agents’ union, is in lock-step with Trump. Of the top 20 posts on its Twitter feed, all but three are retweets of Trump’s personal or campaign messages.
In a video statement embedded on the feed, the union’s president, Brandon Judd, declares that “President Trump is the right candidate for the safety and security of this great nation, not Joe Biden. Please join me in supporting President Trump.”
The Trump-border patrol partnership bears all the hallmarks of a classic quid pro quo. On one side of the deal, the border patrol union lavishes praise on the president and supports his pitch for re-election.
On his side, Trump has repeatedly pushed for more resources for the agency and for its staff union, and is now actively promoting the fulfillment of its dream of becoming a militarized presence on America’s streets. Under his presidency, the brutalized and violent politics of the border are being extended across the nation.
“Trump has ratcheted up political ties to border patrol to another level,” Miller said. “He based his whole 2016 campaign around this, and it is now at the core of his 2020 re-election bid. These are his people.”

'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland

The future of Europe depends on climate action. This is the resounding message that young Europeans have delivered to their leaders over the past two years. To be sure, the wave of young climate activists across the continent, from Fridays for Future to Extinction Rebellion, is part of a global response to the climate crisis. But for the EU in particular, it is also a warning from a new generation of Europeans to their leaders: our European identity hinges on your climate policies.
For our parents’ generation, the European Union defined itself as a protector of peace, a fortress against fascism and a society of (relative) social security. For our generation – we are in our mid-20s – this narrative does not resonate. We came of age in a Europe of crises: a financial collapse, a panic over migration, a surge of populism. These formative moments gave the lie to the notion of a united European identity. To many of us, the EU appeared less a project of democracy, diversity or solidarity than one of bureaucracy, xenophobia and fracture. What is more, Europe’s responses to these crises were hardly material for a new common narrative. Just the opposite: the responses were the crises.
But the climate crisis is different. For one, young Europeans see it not just as a threat, but also a genuine opportunity to build a better world (and a better Europe). An Eupinions poll last year found that 47% of 16- to 25-year-olds believe the environment should be the EU’s top policy priority, nearly 10% more than those in older age groups. Poll after poll – including one conducted by our Europe’s Stories research team, earlier this year – finds young Europeans overwhelmingly supportive of eliminating the EU’s carbon emissions by 2030.
EU leaders, mired in years of failed top-down projects to find “a new narrative for Europe”, have finally taken note. In December 2019, Ursula von der Leyen’s European commission made headlines with its European Green Deal, which aims to turn Europe into the world’s first carbon neutral continent by 2050. While finally bringing its fossil-fuel exit underway, Germany declared climate change one of the key policy priorities for its current council presidency. And European leaders have just negotiated the conditions of a recovery plan, earmarking 30% of both the EU budget and the new recovery fund for climate protection.
Yet so far, Europe has failed to match deeds to words. Negotiations about target dates for carbon neutrality across the continent have been sluggish. Worse, “carbon neutrality” has itself come to serve as a cover for outsourcing emissions to developing countries and investing in “alternative” fuels, such as biomass, that sound green but are really anything but. And despite all the talk, from the outset, the commission’s recovery strategy was set to prop up high-carbon industries once again. Consider one particularly egregious example: airline bailouts. Rescue packages for Lufthansa, Air France and their fellow crisis-hit airlines, amounting to €34.4bn, all came without binding environmental conditions. In the latest budget deal, the safeguards used to guarantee that funds go to green technologies instead of polluting industries remain unclear. In this light, the EU’s grand declarations of climate action could still amount to greenwashing, pure and simple – a narrative without substance.
Hollow narratives cannot endure; they undermine themselves. If EU leaders and national governments continue to soft-pedal and greenwash, they will forfeit the already fragile faith of our generation. 
This loss of faith has already begun: our generation has not failed to notice the discrepancy between EU leaders’ exemplary commitment to climate action on paper and their delays and obfuscations in practice. Our polling for Europe’s Stories suggests that just over half of young Europeans think authoritarian states are better equipped to tackle the climate crisis than democracies – a worrisome but perhaps unsurprising trend that speaks to how urgently young Europeans want climate action, and to the failure of European democracies to meet the moment.

There is a better way forward. And, with governments opening their coffers to save their economies, it’s now or never. Here are a few specific proposals. Instead of asking for minimal (or no) climate commitments from failing airlines and auto manufacturers, the EU could institute a ban on short-haul flights – a policy that 62% of Europeans support – and accelerate the switch to electric vehicles. Instead of bowing to polluting industries on the sly, the EU could exclude emissions-intensive industries and practices, such as the fossil-fuel industry, chemical manufacturers or motorway expansions, from receiving recovery funds – no exceptions – and channel that money into a green public works programme. Instead of sticking with the loophole-ridden target of “carbon neutrality” by 2050, the EU could set a more appropriately ambitious target that includes strict trade regulations that pressure other emissions giants – such as China and the US – to speed up their own energy transitions. Oh, and stop cosying up to fossil-fuel lobbyists.
These measures would set Europe on a path to a just transition: from the third-largest polluter in the world to a genuine climate leader. They would also help to craft a new and durable European identity for a new generation of Europeans. It is up to Europe’s leaders to recognise, before it is too late, that the latter cannot succeed without the former. To save Europe, they will have to save the planet.

To save the EU, its leaders must first focus on saving the planet

A group of more than 80 science fiction and fantasy authors are protesting at the possibility of one of the genres’ biggest conventions being held in Saudi Arabia in 2022, saying that “the Saudi regime is antithetical to everything SFF stands for”.
Led by fantasy author Anna Smith Spark,writers including Charles Stross, Juliet McKenna, Stan Nicholls and Catriona Ward have signed an open letter objecting to Jeddah’s bid to host the World Science Fiction Convention in two years’ time.
Pointing to the fact that homosexuality is illegal and punishable by death in Saudi Arabia, its escalating restrictions on freedom of speech, and the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the writers argue that it is unacceptable to stage an international event against this backdrop.
“On a personal level, we note that many of us would ourselves not be able to write or to live freely under Saudi law. We refuse to attend an event if those staffing it cannot have the same basic freedoms,” they write, in the letter addressed to the board of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) and the 2020 Worldcon chair, Norman Cates. “We express deep concern that many members of the SFF community would be excluded.”
WorldCon, where the winners of the prestigious Hugo awards are announced, has been running every year since 1946, with members of the WSFS voting for each year’s location, and for the Hugo winners. This year’s event will take place, virtually, in New Zealand on Saturday, with next year’s lined up for Washington DC. As well as Jeddah, a bid for 2022 has been submitted by Chicago.
While the writers acknowledge that holding the convention in Jeddah would “open up a new world to fans who may otherwise never have an opportunity to travel there, and show solidarity with creative communities within Saudi Arabia and other Arab states”,they state that “the Saudi regime is antithetical to everything SFF stands for”.
“We stand in solidarity with those who seek change in the country. And we write in protest but also in hope – that by raising awareness of the political situation in Saudi Arabia a WorldCon SA will one day be possible,” say the writers.
Smith Spark said the initial response from the WSFS had been dismissive of the authors’ concerns, but that the response from readers, writers and publishers had been “astonishingly positive”.
An email from the WSFS to Smith Spark said there were “very minimal technical requirements for any group to bid for a Worldcon”, with the selection made by a vote from the entire membership. “[They] vote on the choice, just as they vote on the Hugo awards. Indeed, the process is very similar in both cases, in that Worldcons are not supposed to make subjective value judgments about nominees for the Hugo awards,” the WSFS told Smith Spark. “This decision is reserved to the entire membership, exercising their right to vote.”
Smith Spark said that she was shocked that it had taken an individual to raise the issue. “Our community has expressed deep solidarity with the people of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and disgust that the UK and US governments have such long and deep links with the regime. It’s the Saudi regime that is the antithesis of everything SFF should stand for, absolutely not Islam or Arabic culture to which both science and literature are hugely indebted,” she said on Tuesday. “Many in the community have also expressed outrage that a convention could be considered that would by default exclude many of the most exciting voices in the genre.”

The online fashion retailer Boohoo has promised to “act decisively” on any recommendations made by lawyers investigating its UK supply chain, after it faced allegations that factories making its clothes in Leicester were paying workers below the minimum wage. So far, the company has not committed to publishing the full report.
The independent review is being led by Alison Levitt QC, the former head of law firm Mishcon de Reya’s white-collar crime unit, and on Tuesday the company said her full report would be ready by 15 September for the company to consider.
That is four months earlier than expected and comes after investors – who have seen the value of their shares fall by a third in the wake of a Sunday Times article – pushed for a speedier resolution. The group said it would “provide an update on the findings of the report” alongside its half-year results, which are due a fortnight later on 30 September.
The review’s purpose is to examine Boohoo’s “obligations and relevant duties of care in relation to the workforce in its Leicester supply chain”. Levitt is being assisted by a team of solicitors from TLT, a UK law firm, as well as two junior counsel. The methodology used, which will include a public call for evidence, is to be agreed by Levitt and TLT.
The main objectives are to ascertain whether the allegations are well-founded and, if they are, look at how closely the company monitored its supply chain in Leicester and had knowledge of the allegations. It will also consider the group’s compliance with the relevant law and make recommendations for the company to act upon.
While traditional high street clothing chains have struggled with the rise of online shopping, in less than 15 years Boohoo has gone from a three-employee operation to a business with sales of £1.2bn and a 5,000-strong workforce that ships millions of parcels a week. It now owns a stable of brands including PrettyLittleThing, Nasty Gal, Karen Millen and Warehouse.
However, the company’s share price has fallen sharply since an undercover reporter found staff allegedly being paid as little as £3.50 an hour in the factory, even though the minimum wage in Britain for those aged 25 and over is £8.72.

Brian Small, the Boohoo deputy chairman and senior independent director, said: “We are pleased to share the terms of reference for the upcoming independent review into our Leicester supply chain. We believe this demonstrates how seriously we, as a board, are treating the recent allegations into our supply chain.”
He added: “The group is committed to delivering the highest standards of ethics, compliance and transparency.”
Aneesha Sherman, an analyst at Bernstein, said: “Bringing the date forward is a positive for shareholders, creating a faster path towards getting some clarity and certainty on the magnitude of the problem, as well as outlining the steps that will be taken to resolve it.”

German police are searching an allotment plot on the outskirts of the northern city of Hanover in connection with their investigation of a suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.
A small excavator is being used to clear the plot and police officers are combing the ground with rakes and shovels, according to footage shown on German media.
The police have not revealed what exactly they are hoping to find. But a spokeswoman for state prosecutors in Braunschweig confirmed that the search was taking place as part of its investigation into the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine in Portugal in 2007.

“The operation is occurring in conjunction with our investigation into murder by the 43-year-old suspect,” she told German media.
Braunschweig’s state prosecutor’s office has repeatedly said it has concrete evidence that Christian Brückner – a German man who was living in Praia da Luz when Madeleine was staying in the Algarve town with her family – was involved in her disappearance. It has also said it believes the British girl is dead but has so far declined to give more details.
One resident of Hanover said up to 100 officers had been present at the allotment. Forensics officers in white suits and accompanied by sniffer dogs were also reportedly on the scene.
The allotment lies in the rural region between Hanover Ahlem and Seelze-Letter, and is around 40 miles from Braunschweig, where Brückner was last registered as living. It is flanked by a small house and shed which Brückner is believed to have lived in.
The operation began at dawn on Monday and is due to continue into Wednesday, according to the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, which broke the news.
Earlier this month Portuguese police and divers searched three wells in the area of Vila do Bispo, on the Algarve, according to local media, but police said no evidence was found.
Brückner, who is serving a prison sentence in the city of Kiel for drug trafficking, was named as a main suspect in the disappearance last month. He spent several years living in the Algarve. He has two previous convictions for sexual contact with girls, one for rape, as well as other convictions for theft and fraud.

Thank you for your feedback.




Around the time of McCann’s disappearance, Brückner was telephoning on a mobile phone at a “time and place relevant to the crime”, according to investigators. His name has been raised as a possible suspect since 2013, but investigators say they do not have sufficient evidence to charge him.
Brückner was found guilty last December of the violent rape of an American woman in Praia da Luz in 2005. But he is appealing against the sentence in the European court of human rights. A ruling is expected in just under two weeks. His current prison term is due to expire in January.

Madeleine McCann: German police search garden in Hanover
",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/28/madeleine-mccann-german-police-search-garden-in-hanover
"
The head of Germany’s disease control agency has blamed negligence for a worrying rise in cases in the country, while the World Health Organization has counselled against treating Covid-19 as a seasonal phenomenon or talking about waves of the virus.
The warnings came as Madrid’s regional government imposed new restrictions to halt the spread of the virus in and around the Spanish capital, and the German foreign ministry advised people not to travel to the hard-hit Spanish regions of Aragon, Catalonia and Navarre.
On Tuesday, Lothas Wieler, the head of Germany’s Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said the surge in cases seen over recent weeks was down to people failing to follow guidelines and take the necessary precautions.
Over the past seven days, Germany has registered an average of 557 new cases a day, up from around 350 in early June.
“The new developments in Germany make me very worried,” Wieler said. “The rise has to do with the fact that we have become negligent.”
Germany has fared better than many of its neighbours in suppressing Covid-19, but Wieler urged citizens not to squander the progress and said the virus had to be stopped from “spreading rapidly and uncontrollably” once again.
“It’s in our hands how the pandemic evolves in Germany,” Wieler said, calling on Germans to stick with prevention measures such as washing hands and keeping a safe distance.
Face masks should be worn not only indoors, but also outdoors, if the recommended 1.5-metre (5ft) distancing cannot be maintained, he said, in a subtle update of the prior advice.
The RKI chief said Germans bringing the virus back from their summer holidays was one reason for the surge in cases, but he also pointed to outbreaks happening at workplaces and open-air parties.

“We don’t know yet if this is the beginning of a second wave but of course it could be,” Wieler said. “But I am optimistic that if we follow the hygiene rules we can prevent it. It’s up to us.”
The WHO, meanwhile, urged people to stop looking at the pandemic through a “flu lens” and cautioned against talking about waves.
“Season does not seem to be affecting the transmission of this virus,” said a spokeswoman, Margaret Harris.
“What we all need to get our heads around is this is a new virus … and even though it is a respiratory virus and even though respiratory viruses in the past did tend to do these different seasonal waves, this one is behaving differently,” Harris said.
She said that while some of the hardest-hit countries – such as the US and Brazil - are currently in different seasons, there “seems to be this fixed idea about this virus being seasonal”.
Harris also warned against thinking in terms of virus waves, adding: “It’s going to be one big wave. It’s going to go up and down a bit. The best thing is to flatten it and turn it into just something lapping at your feet.”

In Madrid, which has recorded 74,700 of Spain’s 278,782 cases, the regional government said the wearing of face masks in public would be mandatory at all times from Thursday, and announced restrictions on social gatherings in a bid to head of another enforced confinement.
According to figures from Spain’s official statistics agency, more than 1m jobs were lost between April and June, when the country was in lockdown.
Madrid’s regional president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, said that gatherings inside and outside restaurants and cafes would be limited to 10 people or fewer from Thursday. People were also advised to limit gatherings at home to 10 people.
Díaz Ayuso said that bars and nightclubs – which have been the sources of many new infections – would need to close their doors at 1.30am, and that patrons would have to give their national identification number before entering to facilitate tracing.
Díaz Ayuso also called on young people to behave responsibly.
“We’re worried by the behaviour of a lot of young people,” she said.
“They’re putting their neighbours’ lives at risk, but they’re also risking their academic and employment future. The young people of Madrid need to become our allies.”
Díaz Ayuso said the aim was to avoid a return to the strict lockdown that ran from April to June, adding: “The strategy now is not to go backwards.”
She said she planned to introduce a Covid-19 record book for people who had had the virus or who had been tested.
The regional government has also called on the central government to make sure that people arriving at Madrid’s Barajas airport are given PCR tests on arrival.Madrid’s regional health minister, Enrique Ruiz Escudero, said the area’s hospitals were ready for new coronavirus cases, but warned: “We can’t let our guard down, nor can we take a single step backwards.”
He added 138 people in Madrid had tested positive on Tuesday.
Hours after the British government changed its travel advice to warn people against non-essential visits to the Canary and Balearic islands as well as the Spanish mainland, Germany’s foreign ministry recommended against travel to three regions in northern Spain that are grappling with renewed outbreaks.
“Non-essential, tourist travel to the autonomous communities of Aragon, Catalonia and Navarre are currently discouraged due to renewed high levels of infections and local lockdowns,” a statement said.

Coronavirus: negligence driving increase in cases – German agency
",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/28/coronavirus-negligence-driving-increase-in-cases-german-agency
"
As we at the University and College Union (UCU) lobby the Westminster government for an urgently needed bailout, thousands of the most vulnerable university employees are already losing their jobs.They are vulnerable because the employment model which has developed in higher education in the past 30 years has seen rising levels of casualisation. One third of all academics working in academia are employed on fixed-term contracts, rising to almost half for teaching-only academics (49%) and more than two thirds (67%) for research-only staff. Black and minority ethnic (BAME) academic staff are more likely to be employed on a fixed-term contract, with more than two-fifths (42%) on a fixed-term contract compared to less than a third (31%) of white academic staff.

This reserve army has always been seen as expendable by employers. Every couple of years thousands of researchers are forced to move institutions as their fixed-term contracts end. The summer is an anxious time for casually employed teaching staff as they wait to find out if they have any work in the autumn.But this year is different. At King’s College London, more than a thousand fixed-term staff have been told their contracts are under review. At the University of Liverpool more than 600 face the sack, while the number is around 400 at Goldsmiths and close to 300 at Essex.
That’s almost 2,300 jobs going at just four institutions we know about. If this picture was repeated across the sector then almost 30,000 fixed-term contracts would be at risk.
If the number of jobs being cut is a problem, so too is the way in which institutions are trying to keep it a secret. UCU has only received reliable figures from a handful of universities, despite repeatedly asking for more information.Such a lack of candour is hugely counterproductive. People talk. When cuts are made by stealth it leaves a reservoir of bad feeling not just for those forced out, but for those who remain and have to pick up the work.When the dust settles it will be the institutions which prioritised saving jobs that will emerge from the crisis with their reputations enhanced.Universities already have a huge amount of ground to make up with their staff. The widely supported strikes of early 2020 may seem like a lifetime ago to some observers, but casualisation was at the heart of the action – reflecting the strong desire of UCU members to fight for a different, fairer future.We will continue to press for better treatment for the most vulnerable staff. We do so because we recognise that the struggle against casualisation is important for everyone.
Permanent staff face their own pressures, but they also know that attacks on the most vulnerable are just a precursor for a wider assault upon staff terms and conditions in the shadow of the pandemic.That is why we are today launching 10 practical steps that all staff can take to support their casualised colleagues. The steps range from writing to your MP to lift the lid on casualisation, to joining together with colleagues to raise the issue at department level. Every action is about creating solidarity between all staff.

We believe that casualised staff make a vital contribution to our universities, delivering important research and being responsible for large swathes of teaching. Yet they do so under appalling conditions of insecurity.
This summer many universities are failing to live up to even the most basic commitments to these staff. It’s time for us to fight back.

Around 30,000 jobs may be on the line at universities. We have to fight back

Avni Doshi did not have children when she started writing what would become her debut novel, Burnt Sugar – in fact, she was deeply unsure about whether she wanted them. Over eight drafts in almost as many years, Doshi wrote through her indecision, telling the story of a difficult mother-daughter relationship that is defined by ambivalence on both sides. After submitting her final manuscript in 2018, she gave birth to a baby boy.
When her novel – which was nominated for this year’s Booker prize on Tuesday – was first published in India last year, under the title Girl in White Cotton, Doshi was nervous about revisiting her visions of parenthood. But she was pleased by her own accuracy, even a bit unsettled by it. Her main character, Antara, experiences postpartum depression, as Doshi did.

“I was a bit baffled by the physicality of the experience of becoming a mother,” she says, from her home in Dubai, her husband’s home town. “I had never considered it that deeply outside of my characters. I didn’t imagine, ‘I’m going to be living through some of that’ … Something in my unconscious may have come up that knew what I was going to experience ahead of time.” Given that her book centres on a very dysfunctional relationship between a mother and child, even Doshi is uneasy about the prospect of being proved right again: “I’ve written this now – is it going to come true?”
Burnt Sugar is an unsettling, sinewy debut, startling in its venom and disarming in its humour from the very first sentence: “I would be lying if I said my mother’s misery has never given me pleasure.” Set in Pune, India, the story follows Antara as she reckons with her mother Tara’s cognitive decline and the boiling resentment she still feels over being neglected. As a girl, Antara suffered at the whims of her rebellious young mother, who ran away from her middle-class upbringing to join an ashram, where a guru espoused free love and freer sex. Antara’s name alone – Antara, of Tara, un-Tara – stands as testament to both her mother’s egotism and impetuousness, and their unbreakable tie. As adults, neither woman can stand to be with the other for long, nor can they escape each other. The push-and-pull of their relationship has reverberations for Antara’s art, marriage and views on children, all amplified by Tara’s memory loss even while Antara refuses to let her forget.

The novel has earned praise from Fatima Bhutto, Elizabeth Gilbert and Olivia Sudjic, and seen Doshi compared to Jenny Offill and Deborah Levy. And in the same week it is published in the UK, Burnt Sugar has been announced as one of eight debut novels up for this year’s £50,000 Booker prize, with the judges describing it as an “utterly compelling … sometimes emotionally wrenching but also cathartic”.
When Doshi’s editor called her to tell her the news, she “had to take a moment to lie down and make sure I was still in my body. It was surreal to hear the words. I didn’t think it was possible – I’ve always thought of myself as an outsider.” The achievement is all the more sweet given her long road to publication: “I knew nothing about craft, I knew nothing about writing – I was completely in the dark when I began.”
Born in New Jersey to Indian parents, Doshi studied art history in New York and London before moving to Mumbai, where she worked as a curator. There, in 2012, she rattled off the first draft of her story in a month to meet the deadline for the Tibor Jones South Asia prize for an unpublished manuscript. The five judges unanimously voted her the winner, earning her literary representation – and extensive notes from her new agent.
“I wish I could tell you that it was this slow, beautiful process, that I was homing in on something as clear as a diamond,” Doshi says. “But it was a big mess.”
Over seven years, she wrote eight substantively different drafts (which she has since turned into a conceptual art piece, hanging in her study as a “record of those years of failing,” she says, laughing). The key that unlocked the story was Antara’s voice: caustic, funny, her bitterness towards her mother sometimes giving way to grief. “I was trying to be true to her, trying to get in her head as much as possible,” says Doshi.
She was also inspired by her mother’s family’s connection to the Osho ashram in Pune, founded in 1976 by the controversial guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh – the subject of the Netflix documentary Wild Wild Country – before he relocated to the US to form Rajneeshpuram in Oregon. But Doshi emphasises the “long list of ways” in which the story differs from her own life – not least among them, the fact that she and her mother “are very much on good terms”.
On Tuesday, the Booker judges described the relationship at the heart of Burnt Sugar as “complex and unusual”. While Antara and her mother may be extreme characters, Doshi believes readers may be able to relate to their intensity of feeling and the way they mirror each other against their wills. As Antara describes it: “There was a breakdown somewhere about what we were to one another, as though one of us were not holding up her part of the bargain, her side of the bridge.” Maybe, she concludes, the problem is they are both standing on the same side.

“Even if you have a relatively good relationship with your mother, the maternal complex is so deep-seated in the psyche, any kind of conflict or difficulty with the mother can lead to a fragmentation of one’s own self,” says Doshi. She has realised the truth of this only since writing Burnt Sugar and becoming a mother herself.
Readers may find themselves feeling claustrophobic and deeply uncomfortable as Antara and her mother tussle over whose version of her childhood takes precedence. Some reviewers have even suggested that Burnt Sugar belongs to the horror genre. Doshi has been surprised by some of the reactions: “People have said to me there’s something thriller-like about it: ‘I had a stomach ache reading it, I felt my heart beating.’ I definitely didn’t think about it as being suspenseful.”
Some criticisms Doshi has felt comfortable about dismissing out of hand, including those of one man who thought the male characters were peripheral. “It’s a specific kind of privilege when you expect to see your reflection in every surface,” she says. “The comment says more about him than it does about me and the book.”




 

Motherhood is such a large, expansive word – it almost means nothing

Avni Doshi



Indeed, Burnt Sugar highlights how rarely mother-daughter relationships are explored in depth. Doshi was emboldened by Rachel Cusk and Sheila Heti, authors who treat the subject of “being mothers and being mothered with a sustained seriousness”, and indeed, ambivalence.
In 2017, Doshi wrote an essay for Harper’s Bazaar India about feeling undecided on whether to have children, which sparked a backlash from her family. “I saw how it brought out different sides of all the women I knew,” she says. “There was a lot of fear about my ambivalence. Maybe they all were worried that it was contagious.”
Her mother-in-law contacted an astrologer, who said Doshi was going to have two children – “So there was ‘no point fighting it’,” Doshi recalls. True enough, her son is now two and, a week after we speak, Doshi gave birth to her second child, a girl.
“The more I grow into being a mother, I realise that so much about it has been about tradition, fear, family, pressure – probably a kind of narcissism,” Doshi says. “There’s all of these different sides of myself that I have been coming face-to-face with through the process, that I thought had nothing to do with my decision.”
Motherhood is “such a large, expansive word – it almost means nothing”, says Doshi. She is not yet at work on a new novel, but she wonders how she will go on to treat the subject in future: “I wonder if, now, I’m too close to it. Maybe I have more blindspots today than I did before having children.”
• Burnt Sugar is published by Penguin Random House on 30 July.

Booker nominee Avni Doshi: 'Women feared my ambivalence towards motherhood'

A ransomware attack that took the GPS and smartwatch business Garmin entirely offline for more than three days is believed to have been carried out by a Russian cybercriminal gang which calls itself “Evil Corp”.
Garmin began to restore services to customers on Monday morning, after being held hostage for a reported ransom of $10m, although some services were still operating with limited functionality.
The hack is thought to be just the latest in a long string of attacks on American companies that have earned the cybercriminals’ alleged leader, Maksim Viktorovich Yakubets, 33, a $5m bounty on his head from the FBI. That reward is the highest ever offered for a cybercriminal.
Unlike those behind some previous high-profile ransomware outbreaks, such as the notorious WannaCry and NotPetya campaigns of 2017, Evil Corp has historically been very focused in how it picks and attacks its targets. Rather than going after end users and small businesses, who may be easy to trick into opening a malicious email attachment but unlikely to pay significant ransoms for their data, the organisation has instead deployed a mixture of technical prowess and social engineering to attack sizeable targets such as banks, media organisations and now technology companies.


 Quick guide What is ransomware?  


 Show 


 Hide  


Ransomware is the most common form of criminal malware currently in use. Targets are commonly infected through malicious emails, which may trick them into downloading and running the software, or through exploiting vulnerabilities in other software such as Adobe Flash. When the ransomware program is activated, it encrypts the user’s hard drive with a single use encryption key, before flashing up a message asking for ransom, typically in the form of a payment in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
Usually, although not always, paying the ransom really does restore access to the encrypted files, which means that many businesses and organisations have found themselves funding the criminal outfits that launch ransomware attacks. Even organisations that regularly back up their data have been known to pay the ransom, since the time required to fully restore a large and complicated network from a back-up can be many days, during which no business can be done.
WannaCry, one of the most famous pieces of ransomware, managed to freeze much of the NHS in May 2017. The malware made use of a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Windows operating system to spread automatically between computers, allowing it to rapidly traverse the globe. The attack was launched by a cybercrime group dubbed Lazarus by researchers, which is believed to be a state-backed outfit run by the North Korean government.
Most ransomware attacks are very different from WannaCry, involving highly targeted infections of big targets who are likely to pay a high ransom to receive their data back in good time.

Thank you for your feedback.




Garmin was the latest victim of Evil Corp’s ransomware, dubbed WastedLocker by researchers at cybersecurity firm NCC. The malware, first seen in the wild in May this year, is deployed in a “selective” manner by the outfit, says NCC’s Stefano Antenucci. “Typically, they hit file servers, database services, virtual machines and cloud environments.
“Of course, these choices will also be heavily influenced by what we may term their ‘business model’ – which also means they should be able to disable or disrupt backup applications and related infrastructure. This increases the time for recovery for the victim, or in some cases due to unavailability of offline or offsite backups, prevents the ability to recover at all.”
Whereas WannaCry and NotPetya used vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows to automatically infect new computers, WastedLocker is spread in a more targeted manner. While it is not yet known how Garmin fell prey to the ransomware in early July, researchers in the threat intelligence team of cybersecurity firm Symantec identified one possible route: hijacked newspaper websites.
A US publisher had been attacked by Evil Corp and was unknowingly hosting malware on its newspaper websites, according to Symantec. That malware was used to infect selected visitors with a second set of software that gave the Evil Corp attackers a route to install WastedLocker and hold the company to ransom.
While Symantec declined to name either the publisher, the newspapers or victims, the company said that the attack had hit at least 31 organisations to date, “including many household names. Aside from a number of large private companies, there were 11 listed companies, eight of which are Fortune 500 companies. All but one of the targeted organisations are US-owned, with the exception being a US-based subsidiary of an overseas multinational”.
Writing almost a month before the Garmin outage, Symantec warned: “The attackers behind this threat appear to be skilled and experienced, capable of penetrating some of the most well protected corporations, stealing credentials, and moving with ease across their networks. As such, WastedLocker is a highly dangerous piece of ransomware. A successful attack could cripple the victim’s network, leading to significant disruption to their operations and a costly clean-up operation.

However Evil Corp installed WastedLocker on Garmin’s systems, the ransomware’s next step was the same: it charged through the most sensitive parts of the company’s network and encrypted essential files, before demanding a ransom in exchange for the decryption key.
Although Garmin would not confirm the level of the requested ransom, it is believed to be around $10m, according to a source quoted by the industry site Bleeping Computer.

By Monday morning, Garmin had succeeded in restoring many services, according to a status dashboard it published. But Garmin Connect, which allows users to upload data from fitness trackers to Garmin and on to other services such as Strava, is operating with “limited functionality”: many uploads are “queued” or “delayed”, including Strava integration itself.
Even before WastedLocker, Evil Corp had become one of the most notorious cybercrime groups operating today. In December 2019, the US government took action against the organisation over its “Dridex” campaign, which used malware to harvest login credentials from banks and led to the theft of more than $100m. The campaign led to the American Department of Justice criminally charging two of the group’s members and the Department of State offering a $5m reward for information that helps capture or convict Yakubets.
